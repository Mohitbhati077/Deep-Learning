This is why Parliament is getting adjourned repeatedly,” Jairam Ramesh said.Rajya Sabha has also witnessed repeated adjournments on the issue. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"18 December, 2023 ","Adhir Ranjan, A Raja and more: Lok Sabha suspends 33 more MPs for misconduct during Winter Session, total suspension stands at 46",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/33-parliamentarians-suspended-from-lok-sabha-winter-session-misconduct/,"In February 2012, Mamata Banerjee made Urdu the second language in areas of West Bengal where the population of Urdu speakers was equal or more than 10%.On Saturday (16th December), a video of incumbent Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim endorsing Urduisation of West Bengal went viral on social media.In a video shared on X (formerly Twitter) by user ‘Mintu Roy’, Hakim was heard saying, “Inshallah, one day will come when half of the population of Bengal will speak Urdu and recite poetry.” His remark aimed at the promotion of Urdu in West Bengal was greeted with applause by Muslims present at the event. It must be mentioned that Bengalis have a history of resisting the imposition of non-native languages particularly Urdu. Watch the video👇 pic.twitter.com/sXzRjE4yuBIn fact, one of the reasons leading up to the Bangladesh Liberation War was the imposition of Urdu over Bengali in then-East Pakistan. As such, the prophecy by Kolkata Mayor that half of the State of West Bengal will one day speak in Urdu was meant to spark controversy. The viral video of Firhad Hakim was recorded on 11th February 2021 during an event hosted by the West Bengal Urdu Academy.During the event dubbed ‘Mushaira 2021’, he was heard saying, “There was a time when Urdu speakers did not feel like they belonged to Bengal. There was no official status for Urdu. I want to thank Mamata Banerjee for making Urdu the second official language of Bengal.”“We have increased the budget of the Urdu Academy to ₹15 crore,” he informed. Firhad Hakim said that his ancestors came from Bihar and spoke Urdu at home. He also called upon the West Bengal Urdu Academy to take measures to propagate the language in the State of West Bengal.It must be mentioned that Mamata Banerjee engaged in appeasement politics soon after becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2011. A year later in February 2012, she made Urdu the second language in areas of the State where Urdu speakers were equal to or more than 10% of the population.The Trinamool Congress government had identified a total of 18 such Urdu-speaking areas -Goalpokhar I and II blocks, Islalmpur block, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Islampur Municipality, Garulia Municipality, Titagarh Municipality, Kamarhati Municipality, Bhatpara Municipality, Champdani Municipality, Bansberia Municipality, Bhadreswar Municipality, Rishra Municipality, Asansol Municipal Corporation, Jamuria Municipality, Raniganj Municipality, Kulti Municipality and Bally Municipality.However, this is not the first time when the Mayor of Kolkata has been in the news for the wrong reasons. In April 2016, he had dubbed a Muslim-dominated area of Kolkata as ‘Mini-Pakistan‘ In February 2021, he was spotted delivering a political speech at a masjid in Kolkata, in blatant violation of the Model Code of Conduct. To pacify Muslim rioters during the anti-CAA movement, Firhad Hakim referred to them as ‘brothers.’ The Kolkata Mayor was earlier seen referring to the Central Armed forces and the BJP as ‘Suar er baccha‘ (progency of pigs).Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

But much remains to be done, particularly because Rajasthan’s economy suffered considerable harm due to the previous Congress administration under Ashok Gehlot.In Rajasthan, changing the government every five years has become a trend for the past thirty years. Nevertheless, the state’s economy has suffered each time the Congress government has taken office. The statistics indicate the same thing this time around.Although Rajasthan has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the nation and a massive debt load, its GDP has not increased significantly over the previous five years.

He said that such deliberate actions of the Chief Minister precipitate the breakdown of constitutional machinery.Coming down heavily on Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday accused him of attempting to disrupt the peaceful ambience in the state. Speaking to reporters, Vijayan said, “Arif Mohammad Khan is making a move to destroy the peaceful ambience of Kerala.”After facing a black-flag protest from members of the SFI, the students’ wing of the ruling CPI(M), the Governor claimed an attempt on his life.However, the chief minister said the governor’s actions were such that they sparked protests.CM Vijayan further highlighted the comments made by former Supreme Court justice Rohinton Nariman in a public event in Mumbai, outlining the “wholesale reference to the President,” of Bills by the Kerala governor.Vijayan further accused the governor of allegedly accepting proposals from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which, according to him, resulted in the student protests. The chief minister opposed his actions, calling them “totally wrong.”Also drawing attention to the Governor’s choice of words, Vijayan questioned how he could use such harsh language. He also expressed concern over the Governor’s approach towards individuals, who showed him black flags. He termed the action as ‘provocative’.Earlier, SFI (Students Federation of India), the student wing of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), staged a black-flag protest march to Calicut University, ahead of the Governor’s arrival on campus.Black banners and posters were put up outside Calicut University Guest House where the Governor was staying. The protesters were, however, removed from the spot by the police on the instruction of the Governor’s office.A statement from Raj Bhavan mentioned that the Governor took serious note of the action of the state police, on the direction of the Chief Minister, in placing posters defamatory to him on the campus of Calicut University.The Governor earlier claimed that the police were prevented from acting against ‘criminals’. He also accused CM Vijayan of hatching a conspiracy to harm him.“This is not a question of my comment, as I said in the morning. It is about law. We are a democratic republic and the law must prevail. The police stood like silent bystanders while the protesters were at it. It was because of political reasons that they stood by idly. My car was surrounded and the protesters banged on it with all the force that they could muster,” the Governor said.He added that he was not scared of anyone. “Due to political reasons, the Kerala Police were prevented from acting against these rowdies and criminals. I believe in facing up to brutes. I am not scared of anyone,” he added. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

On 17th December (Sunday), Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said that the Supreme Court’s 11th December ruling on Article 370 is not a “God’s verdict”. Speaking with reporters in Kupwara, she asserted that her party, PDP will continue to struggle for the restoration of special status to Jammu and Kashmir.Mufti said, “We don’t have to lose heart. We will continue our struggle. The Supreme Court is not God. The same Supreme Court had earlier said that Article 370 cannot be amended without the recommendation of a constituent assembly. They were also learned judges. Today some other judges passed the ruling. We cannot treat it as God’s verdict.”#WATCH | On Supreme Court verdict on Article 370 in J&K, PDP Chief Mehbooba Mufti says, ""…Supreme Court's verdict is not God's verdict, we will not lose hope and will continue our fight."" pic.twitter.com/iDpFN7TWDWShe claimed that those who oppose special status to Jammu and Kashmir, want “us to give up” on our fight. The PDP President stressed that they will not lose hope and continue the fight in this regard. She added, “Our opponents want us to give up the fight but we will continue till our last breath. We have made a lot of sacrifices and we cannot let them go in vain.” Previously, the PDP leader had described the apex court’s verdict on pleas challenging the abrogation of Article 370 as a “death sentence” not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the idea of India. Stating that the struggle in the region has been a political fight spanning several decades, Mufti had urged people not to lose hope.  Likewise, Omar Abdullah, the vice-president of the National Conference, conveyed his disappointment over Article 370 article. Dil na umeed tou nahi ⁰Na kaam hi tou hai ⁰Lambi hai gham ki shaam⁰Magar shaam hi tou haiIt is important to note that both the valley leaders who have been actively seen indulging in political activities had earlier claimed that they were house-arrested by the LG administration in the wake of the Article 370 verdict. They had also alleged that were they not allowed to talk with reporters. However, the claim was immediately rejected by Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha and Srinagar Police calling their allegations “totally baseless”.On 11th December, the Supreme Court of India upheld the Centre’s decision to abrogate Article 370 which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The five-judge constitutional bench noted that J&K did not retain any sovereignty after the instrument of accession was signed and there is no internal sovereignty for Jammu and Kashmir. It also ruled that Article 370 was a temporary provision. The court also asked the Election Commission to conduct the election to the Union Territory’s Assembly by September 30 next year.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-led government at the Centre under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked Article 370, taking away the special status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir on 5th August 2019. The state was then reorganised into two Union Territories, Ladakh and Jammu, and Kashmir.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","Ashok Gehlot ruined Rajasthan’s economy, left a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore on the state, failed to boost GDP",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ashok-gehlot-rajasthans-economy-left-a-debt-of-rs-5-37-lakh-crore-on-the-state-failed-to-boost-gdp/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","‘Islam is incompatible with Europian culture’: 5-year-old video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni goes viral, reported as recent statement",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/islam-is-incompatible-with-europian-culture-5-year-old-video-of-italian-pm-giorgia-meloni-goes-viral-fact-check/,"In the video, Meloni is seen saying, ""Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.""on 17th and 18th December, a video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni went viral on social media. As per the subtitles in the video, she was seen saying that Islam is not compatible with European values and culture. Islam is being perpetrated (in Italy) through Saudi Arabia’s funding and Saudi Arabia has Sharia law. Meloni further says that the Sharia law is not compatible with Europian values and culture. The whole of Europe is being Islamised.There is no similarity between our culture and Islam.Islam is being spread by Saudi in Italy.There is Sharia law in Saudi, which we will not allow to be implemented in Italy.: Georgia Meloni, PM, Italy pic.twitter.com/uCqYhpodBuThe same alleged statement was reported by a number of media houses, mostly Indian. ""यूरोप में हमारी सभ्यता के मूल्यों से बहुत दूर इस्लामीकरण की एक प्रक्रिया चल रही है.""◆ इटली की प्रधानमंत्री जॉर्जिया मेलोनी ने कहा #Europe #Islam | #GeorgiaMeloni pic.twitter.com/VRiLgytMfsMany media portals reported that her statement came after the recent political festival held in Italy by her party, The Brothers of Italy party, where UK PM Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk were also in attendance. A number of Indian media houses including WION, Hindustan Times, Mint, NDTV, and Times Now reported the same claims. NDTV used a X post embed of a handle named Geopolitical Kid and wrote that Meloni’s statement was given during the political event organised by her party. However, Meloni’s statement regarding Islam’s alleged incompatibility wasn’t found in any international publications in the last 24-hour window. Radio Genoa, a popular handle on X, seemed to have first posted the video. Italian PM Giorgia Meloni: “I believe that there is a problem of compatibility between Islamic culture and the values ​​and rights of our civilization. The Islamic cultural centers in Italy are financed by Saudi Arabia where Sharia is in force. In Europe there is a very… pic.twitter.com/wEn8Fl4JC2However, Radio Genoa has not cited a time frame, and has not written that Meloni’s statement was recent. Upon searching with the keywords and comparing it with Meloni’s video clip going viral, we found that the original video was posted on YouTube back in 2018. The video was posted by the YouTube channel alanews in 2018. The original video can be seen here. In the video, Meloni is seen saying, “Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.”In that video, Meloni was referring to a previous statement by another conservative leader Matteo Salvini. Salvini, referring to the Cologne mass sexual attacks and Berlin terrorist attack, had said that Islam is incompatible with European values. Salvni is a leader of Italy’s Lega Nord party. Conclusion: While the viral video of Giorgia Meloni is mostly correct in rough translation, the video, or the statement, are not recent. They are from 5 years ago, and not from the recent political event organised by Meloni’s party. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did Pakistani caretaker PM confirm that unknown men poisoned Dawood Ibrahim? Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-check-pakistani-caretaker-pm-dawood-ibrahim-death-confirmation/,"Dawood Ibrahim was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. On Monday (18th December), social media was abuzz with rumours of the death of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, who has been hiding in Pakistan for decades. As per the rumours, Ibrahim was poisoned by an unknown person, and he was rushed to hospital. Some posts on social media claimed he was critical, while others claimed that he died. The rumours began spreading on Sunday (17th December) after Pakistan’s internet went down.Amid the rumours, an alleged screenshot of caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar Ul Haq Kakar, went viral on social media with claims that the said post confirmed the death of Ibrahim. The post read, “The Messiah of humanity, dear to every Pakistani heart, our beloved His Excellency Dawood Ibrahim passed away due to poisoned by unknown. He breathed his last in a hospital in Karachi. May Allah grant him the highest position in Jannat. Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.”However, when OpIndia investigated the screenshot and the official handle of the Pakistani PM, we found that there was no such tweet. Furthermore, the handle used in the screenshot was anwaar_kakkar, while the real ID of the Pakistani PM is anwaar_kakar. There is a handle called anwaar_kakkar, but that is a fan account of PM Kakar, and there was no such tweet either. It was evident that someone artificially created the post by adding text and a Grey Verified Check Mark on the fan account.Pakistani journalists also fuelled the rumours. In a recent episode of Bheja Fry, Pakistani journalist Aarzoo Kazmi talked about the rumours surrounding the poisoning of Dawood Ibrahim and his critical health in the hospital. She highlighted the fact that there was an internet shutdown in the country and emphasised that something was happening in Pakistan. She also talked about the rumours of Dawood Ibrahim’s poisoning and critical health. While she fanned the rumours, the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed.As per Aaj Tak, Ibrahim was indeed admitted to the hospital two days back. It is unclear what was the reason, but several reports talked about the rumours of him being poisoned.Though the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed, it was indeed a fact that internet services faced a massive crackdown in Pakistan on 17th December. Social media services and search engines stopped working without any prior notice. No one could access social media platforms like X, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and the Google search engine was down. While it was rumoured that the crackdown was because of the poisoning of Ibrahim, in reality, it appeared that the Pakistani government shut down the internet to limit the access and circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer in Mumbai. It is believed that he now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.While Ibrahim’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refused to accept his presence in the country.OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The X users circulated the visuals from the Gomti bridge with misleading claims that the authority scattered their goods and assaulted the vendors. However, they were immediately fact-checked by the Lucknow Police. Spinning Police action as oppression of the poor, Asif Khan tweeted, “Poor Kashmiri dry fruit vendors were harassed by Lucknow Municipality team.

VIP movement traverses through this route because of which the  Municipal corporation and police regularly carry out anti-encroachment drives.”Misleading. @zoo_bear won't share that – vendors were asked to vacate no-vending zone several times before.

He added that the corporation had taken action previously, and the police had communicated with the vendors. East DCP Lucknow mentioned that today (17th December), the convoy of UP CM Yogi Adityanath also passed through this route. He added that today the dry fruit vendors showed indecency with the anti-encroachment team. Subsequently, when the police came to learn about the incident, they used the necessary force and brought the youths to the police station. They have been informed that this is a VIP route adding that they should cooperate with the anti-encroachment drives in the future as well.It is also notable that while the X users claimed police threw away the dry fruits being sold by the street vendors, others have said that the vendors themselves dropped the products on the streets after police asked them to vacate the place. Therefore, the police removed the street vendors not because of their identities as Kashmiris, but only because they were vending at an unauthorised place.

On 18th December (Monday), the Times of India commemorated the birth anniversary of Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin describing him as ‘The Man of Steel’.

CPI(M)’s Puducherry unit praising the Communist dictator wrote, “Comrade Joseph Stalin, born on December 18, 1878, a revolutionary Bolshevik who led the victorious Antifascist war and laid the foundation for a strong working-class state of the planet.

Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labour camps, forced collectivisation, famine and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women.In a century, communist states have killed approximately 100 million people, according to Ilya Somin’s articles. Joseph Stalin’s attempts to collectivise agriculture and production in Russia resulted in the deaths of 6 to 10 million people. Stalin imposed collective agriculture, prohibiting people from cultivating on their own, and imprisoning dissenters in Siberian labour camps. In Russia and Ukraine, millions went hungry, and hundreds of thousands died in prison camps. When Ukrainian production fell short of Stalin’s quota, he punished them even more by taking away everything they had. In Ukraine, Stalin’s forced famine is termed ‘Holodomor’ by joining the words for hunger (holod) and mor (extermination or mass-murder).Stalin’s atrocities were not restricted to the Soviet famine; he also carried out the ‘Great Purge,’ in which everyone he disapproved of was imprisoned, tortured, or executed. No one was spared, even wealthy peasants, politicians, military men, and ethnic minorities. The Purge alone is thought to have killed over 1.2 million people.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"17 December, 2023 ","Party wanted to deny him ticket, those who helped him are dead or in BJP: Rajdeep Sardesai tries to defend Congress over scam accused...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/rajdeep-sardesai-defends-congress-it-raids-dhiraj-prasad-sahu-controversy/,"""Among his key benefactors is someone who is no longer alive and held the purse strings of the Congress for a very long time. Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,"" Sardesai had claimed.Days after the Income Tax (IT) Department recovered a whopping ₹353 crore from the offices of Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai came to the rescue of the Congress MP.In a video posted on his YouTube channel on Friday (16th December), Sardesai claimed that the scam-tainted politician had no chance of being a Parliamentarian. While citing a make-believe ‘source’, he alleged that the Congress wanted to deny Sahu a ticket to the Rajya Sabha in 2018. The controversial ‘journalist’ claimed that the party relented after leaders, who have now defected to the BJP, lobbied for him. He also made reference to a ‘dead’ Congress leader who supposedly influenced the decision of the party to send Dhiraj Prasad Sahu to the Rajya Sabha.At a time when the grand-old-party is under scanner over allegations of corruption, Rajdeep Sardesai was seen making a last-ditch effort to give a clean chit to the Congress’ high command.“A senior Congress leader from Jharkhand claims Sahu was to be denied a ticket in 2018 but he reportedly managed to get his Rajya Sabha nomination at the very last moment with the help of a very key people in the Congress hierarchy in the National Capital,” he was heard saying.“Among his key benefactors is someone who is no longer alive and held the purse strings of the Congress for a very long time. Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,” Sardesai brazened out.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress from Jharkhand. His family has been associated with the Congress party since independence. He became RS MP in by-polls in 2009 for the first time. In 2010, he was elected as RS MP for the second time; in 2018, he was re-elected for RS by Congress for the third time. He actively participates in parliamentary proceedings. Sahu was part of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra. In recent raids at Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd, where Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner, the Income Tax Department recovered ₹353 cr of unaccounted cash. Congress Party has distanced itself from the controversy.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. But this is completely fake and misleading claim, and no Muslim is making the main idol of Ram Lalla.In fact, other media reports on Jamaluddin make it clear that he is making a decorating idol using fibre for the opening ceremony of Ram Mandir. As per a report by India Today, Mohammed Jamaluddin and his son Bittu have been engaged in creating some statues that will adorn the temple complex. The report stated that he is making life-size fibre statues.Other reports make it clear that the fibre statutes of Lord Ram and other Gods will be used to decorate the temple complex and the Ayodhya City during the inauguration ceremony. TV9 reported that statues of Lord Ram will be placed in major intersections in Ayodhya, and some of these idols are being made by Jamaluddin and his son.After several social media users pointed out the misleading claim made by News24, the media house later deleted the tweet.Fibre idols are generally used for decorative purposes, and they are not used as the main deity in temples. Most deities in Hindu temples are made from various types of stones, while temporary idols made for annual festivals are made using clay. Fibre idols last longer than clay, but are much easier to make compared to carving stone. Fibre idols are generally made for export, as they are lighter and easy to transport with the risk of damage. Notably, not one but three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya by three separate artists, and one of them will be picked by a committee to be placed in Sanctum Santorum, after which the pran pratistha rituals will be conducted by priests. Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, had earlier informed that the three different idols are being made by three sculptors – Ganesh Bhatt and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka and Satyanarayan Pandey from Jaipur. Two of the idols are being made using two stones from Karnataka and one from Rajasthan. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable.Ganesh Bhatt of Karnataka is carving out the idol from Nellikaru rock or black stones which is also known as Shyam shila or Krishna shila. Famous sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Mysore, who sculpted the 12-ft statue of Adi Shankaracharya unveiled by PM Modi in Kedarnath, is sculpting another idol using another rock from Karnataka. Satya Narayan Pandey of Rajasthan is carving the Ram Lalla idol from white Makrana marble stones. All three artists are chiselling the idols based on a sketch by renowned artist Vasudeo Kamath from Mumbai.The 51-inch-tall Ram Lalla depicts the child form of Lord Ram, same as the current smaller idol that was placed in the makeshift temple for over half a century. The idol will depict five-year-old Ram Lalla sitting on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Many other symbols related to Lord Ram will carved on the statue.While one idol will be selected to be permanently placed in the sanctum sanctorum, the other two idols will be placed in prominent places inside the temple premises.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Musk wrote, “I’m literally rofl rn.” Indian American businessman and GOP Presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy faced an embarrassing moment when he forgot to mute his mic while taking a ‘loo break’ from an active X (Twitter) space. Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform. However, interjecting in the conversation, Ramaswamy conveyed that he would have to take a short break, hurriedly stating, “Gentlemen, I have to go.” While Elon Musk continued the discussion, the unmistakable sound of running water could be heard in the background.Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy takes a piss with his mic on during an 𝕏 Space with 100K+ listenersElon Musk: “I hope you feel better”Vivek: “I feel great, thank you” pic.twitter.com/3ljslTqnpXPointing towards unusual noises, Alex Jones sarcastically remarked, “Someone’s got their thing open peeing. Somebody’s got their phone in the bathroom.” Responding to Jones’ remark, the host Mario Nawfal alerted Ramaswamy that the source of the noise was his phone. Nawfal said, “Vivek, that’s your phone. But I am not able to mute you.” On returning from the short break, Vivek Ramaswamy realised that his mic was unmuted and understood what had transpired. He immediately apologised for the embarrassing moment. However, on a lighter note, Musk quips, “I hope you feel better now”. To which Ramaswamy replied, “I feel great. Sorry about that guys.”While the awkward moment was initially met with stunned silence, it sparked a flurry of witty reactions. Musk later responded to the post that had caught the incident stating that he was bursting into uncontrollable laughter.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed a gun at a policeman during the anti-Hindu riots in North-East Delhi in 2020, was refused regular bail by a Delhi court on 14th December. The court stated it observed no need to grant him bail and Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat of Karkardooma Court noted, “Considering the conduct of the accused Shahrukh Pathan in jail during his judicial custody, his conduct prior to his being arrested, conduct during court proceedings and most importantly, the allegations against the accused which are being supported by the eyewitnesses and also the video footage, on any of the counts on which bail can be considered, the court sees nothing to set him enlarged on bail.”The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha,n the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which was accepted by the court. The case pertains to the infamous picture where Shahrukh Pathan was seen holding a gun to a police officer’s head during the Delhi anti-hindu riots. During the riot, on the 24th of February 2020, a confrontation broke out between Jaffrabad Metro Station and Maujpur Bridge. There were more than 5,000 people who came face to face in that area. The anti-CAA protestors (Islamist mob) were pelting stones and brandishing guns. When the investigation was carried out, 3 cartridges were found at the spot where Shahrukh Pathan brandished a gun, aimed at the head of a police officer in uniform. The order details how Shahrukh Pathan first fired a few rounds at the crowd and refused to pay heed to the warnings issued by the police officer. When he advanced, for the safety of the crowd, the police officer stood in his path and did not move. When Pathan was at a distance of 9-10 feet from the police officer, he fired his weapon aimed at the police officer’s head to kill him. The police officer dodged the bullet but continued to stand there in his path so he couldn’t advance further and kill the Hindus. As the police officer refused to move, Pathan pushed the officer and then aimed the gun at his head again. When the police officer issued another warning after being pushed, Shahrukh Pathan fired at the crowd and started retreating. It was only after sustained interrogation that Shahrukh Pathan revealed his full identity and confessed to his involvement in the crime. The prosecution has also argued that Shahrukh Pathan was not only attempting to kill the police officer but was also leading the mob. Interestingly, the order reveals how Shahrukh Pathan was not cooperative during the investigation and refused to reveal the identity of other rioters who were involved. During the investigation, it is detailed, that Pathan also tried his best to mislead the police. He has also displayed aggressive and remorseless conduct in jail. The prosecution argued that if let out on bail, he could potentially influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. Also, given the fear of the 10-year jail term that could be handed to him, he could abscond. Taking into account his conduct inside the jail and during the investigation, the court agreed with the prosecution and refused to grant him bail. In the order document detailing the arguments of the prosecution, there was one specific argument that deserved further investigation. The prosecution had argued that Shahrukh Pathan’s father, Sabir Ali (alias Baldev Singh) was convicted for 10 years with a fine of Rs 1 lac under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and sections of the NDPS Act. OpIndia pulled up the court judgement in the case where Shahrukh Pathan’s father was convicted by a Delhi court. The judgement convicting him was pronounced on 11th August 2016. The facts of the case, detailed in the court order, almost read like a movie. In January 2010, Meghalaya Police filed a complaint in Delhi that three Pakistani nationals Abdul Razzaq, Mohd. Saddique and Rafakat Ali who had been brought from Lampur Seva Sadan (FRRO detention centre) on 1st January 2010 to Guru Nanak Eye Hospital for their medical examination had escaped while they were being taken back. During the investigation to track down the missing Pakistanis, the visitor’s register which was maintained by Meghalaya Police was also checked. The entries in the register made from 28/9/2009 to 02/01/2010 revealed that two people – Anees Khan and Arbaz Khan – had met Abdul Razzaq and Saleem on 29/12/2009 and 30/12/2009. During interrogation, it was revealed that before absconding on 1/1/2010, the three Pakistanis had after going to Gurunanak Eye Hospital were first taken to Jama Masjid and then one of them (Abdul Razzak) was taken by him to Seelampur near Jaffarbad to collect money from someone. Anees and Arbaz were nephews of Sabir Ali. It is pertinent to understand here that the three Pakistanis were in India illegally and therefore, were being held at a detention centre. From the story so far, it is also clear that they were given harbour at Jama Masjid from where one of them was taken to Seelampur (near Jaffrabad) to collect money – the very area where the Delhi anti-Hindu riots had broken out in February 2020 – in which Shahrukh Pathan was also leading a mob. Based on this investigation, Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh), Anees Khan and Arbaz were called to the Special Cell office and inquiries were made from them. During interrogation, it was revealed that it was Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh) who had given money to Abdul Razzaq at Seelampur before he had absconded. Essentially, from the records so far, it is clear that it was Shahrukh Pathan’s father who had give money to a Pakistani before they had absconded. This money was give to the illegal in Seelampur. The numbers that were taken from the accused during interrogation were then thoroughly investigated after those detained and questioned – including the father of Shahrukh Pathan – were set free. During the surveillance of the numbers, it was revealed that the accused – including Pathan’s father – were involved in the business of fake currency and drugs. There was also an intercepted call where Sabir Ali had spoken about the international smuggling of drugs. After this surveillance, when a notice was served to Sabir Ali, Arbaz and Anees, they refused to answer the notice served by the special cell. The Special Cell then received information about a Charas and Smack delivery that Sabir Ali and his co-accused Sannaullah Mir were about to make. When the raiding party intercepted Ali and Mir, they discovered drugs in their possession. Substantial amounts of drugs were also found on the scooter of Sabir Ali – the substance in the scooter was heroin. After the subsequent arrest, Mir and Ali were interrogated separately. During interrogation, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, Sabir Ali, confessed that he was in the business of drugs and fake currency notes along with his associates Anees, Arbaz, Jarnail and Mir. He also disclosed how the police could arrest Jarnail Singh and revealed that on an earlier occasion, Singh had given him 2 lacs and drugs, parts of which were then distributed to the others. He also agreed to lead the police to another accused – Javed. Several of the co-accused were then arrested post-interrogation of Ali. In 2011, all the accused persons were charged for the offences u/s 29 r.w.s. 21, 20 and 23 of the NDPS Act and accused Sabir Ali was separately charged for the offence u/s 21(c), 25A of the NDPS Act and accused Sanaullah Mir was separately charged for the offence of u/s 20 (b) (ii) (C) of the NDPS Act. All the accused persons were also charged for the offences u/s 489 C r.w.s. 120B IPC.In court, the prosecution examined 39 witnesses in all to prove its case against the accused. All the accused, including the father of Shahrukh Pathan, took the defence that they had been falsely implicated by the police and that no contraband/counterfeit currency notes had been recovered from their possession or at their instance at any point in time. Among all the accused, the court ‘particularly’ was intrigued by the defence of Sabir Ali alias Baldev Singh. It is pertinent to mention here that Shahrukh Pathan’s father was previously a Sikh named Baldev Singh and had converted to Islam before marrying. When Sabir Ali started explaining why he was supposedly implicated by the police, he ended up revealing his long illustrious career as a criminal. Here is what the court document said: “In particular accused Baldev Singh has stated that he originally belongs to Punjab and shifted to Delhi in 1984 due to political turmoil and terrorist activities in Punjab. In Delhi he started selling garments from a patri in Chandni Chowk but in the year 1984 the police officials of Maurice Nagar falsely arrested him on a mere suspicion that he was a terrorist. When their enquiry into his antecedents did not reveal anything incriminating against him, they planted contraband on him and falsely implicated him in a case under the Excise Act. After spending three years in the jail in the said case, he came out and started working as a driver for a transport company. During the said services a vehicle which he was driving was intercepted by DRI and contraband was recovered from the same. Though he had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the contraband concealed in the said vehicle, he was arrested by DRI and also subsequently convicted in the said case and again spent more than 10 years in judicial custody. After coming out from the jail after undergoing the sentence in the said case he again started his life afresh and started doing the business of pannis/plastics and started living with his children, his wife, his brother in law, Anees and Arbaz, the son of his second brother in law Babu Khan, in his house H.No. U­108, Gali no. 5, Arvind Nagar, Gautam Vihar, Gonda. He suspects that somebody in his locality informed the local police officials about his previous records and that is why the officials of Special Cell came to his residence in the first week of January, 2010 and forcibly picked him, his son and Anees and Arbaz and took them to PS and started inquiring about same Pakistani nationals who had absconded. Though they were released from the PS after the police officials found nothing incriminating against them, on 3/9/2010 again he, Anees and Arbaz were forcibly picked up from their residence at 1:30 a.m. in the night and brought to the office of Special cell, Rohini and falsely implicated in this case”. Essentially, Shahrukh Pathan’s father at the time had asserted that he was being falsely implicated by the police in this case of collusion with Pakistanis and being involved in an international drug peddling and fake currency racket because he had done exactly that in the past, been convicted for it, and therefore, the police thought of him as a convenient target. Further, he also dared to claim that all the previous times he was caught with contrabands and convicted, even then, he was falsely implicated. The shoddy defence that was put up by Sabir Ali was backed only by one witness – the witness’ only testimony was that he had never seen a Pakistani enter the home of Ali. This statement was made without any evidence. The court said, “The testimony of the prosecution witnesses is trustworthy and believable and nothing has emerged in their cross­examination which cast doubt on the veracity of their statement or to impeach their creditworthiness”. The court also said that all the seizure of drugs and fake currency was done per the law. While the defence tried to puncture technical holes in the process, the court threw out all of their arguments and convicted the accused – including Sabir Ali. To that effect, the court said, “as far as recovery of contraband from accused Baldev Singh and Sanaullah is concerned, in my view, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt”. While the court rejected the argument that the accused were colluding with each other, it convicted all accused for the possession of contraband substances, however, there was amply evidence of collusion as well based on the statements of Ali. Based on this evidence, Sabir Ali, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1 lac fine in 2016. According to reports, Shahrukh’s mother also is said to be a notorious drug peddler.In his show ‘Prime Time’ on 26th February 2020, Ravish Kumar resorted to spreading half-truths and full lies about the horrifying spate of violence that had engulfed the national capital. In pursuance of what appeared as his agenda to tarnish Hindus and portray them as the aggressors of the riots, Kumar identified Mohammad Shahrukh alias Shahrukh Pathan, who fired at Delhi Police personnel on February 24, as one ‘Anurag Mishra’. For the 26th February show, Ravish claimed that police had not yet arrested him while he was arrested on 25th February itself, good 24 hours before his show premiered. “Police ki haalat yeh hai ki abhi tak giraftar nahin hua hai. Police saaf kehti hai ki Shahrukh hai magar aap social media mein dekhiye Anurag Mishra bataya jaa raha hai. (Situation of the Police is such that they have not yet arrested him. Police says his name is Shahrukh but if you see on social media, he is called Anurag Mishra),” he spoke in his characteristic drawl during the show. Naturally, it was quite a revelation since no one had yet referred to the shooter as “Anurag Mishra” till then.He then asked Delhi Police to speak out on his identity again. He then played an undated speech of his reporter who appeared to be asking Delhi Police personnel about Shahrukh’s arrest. Slyly, Ravish Kumar then played the videos of BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma addressing rallies ahead of Delhi elections to cast aspersions that their speeches were responsible for stoking riots a month later. Further, in August 2021, 18 months after the 25-year-old Delhi anti-Hindu riots accused Shahrukh Pathan was arrested for brandishing a gun at the police and threatening them, The Quint published a white paper on him watering down his crime and making him appear like a cherubic saint. The Quint started by describing his menacing march as ‘brazen confidence in his gait’. Then the writer of the ‘Shahrukh Pathan fan page’ romanticised his criminal act. “Unfazed by the policemen in riot gear, he shot bullets in the air while media persons captured his acts in astonishment. The fact that the gym enthusiast, who was also a local, did not wear a mask to hide his identity, made his ‘bravado’ seem peculiar and odd,” the author wrote. The Quint then went on to explain how his friends described Shahrukh as someone who was into grooming and was interested in his appearance. He was characterised as someone who was a biryani-lover, liked to put gel in his hair, blow dry it, wear crisp, ironed shirts, good shoes and well, make TikTok videos. The author interviewed Pathan’s mother, who had glowing views about her son. She said her son was innocent and ‘simple-minded’.Shahrukh’s mother also highlighted counterfactual scenarios to water down her son’s criminality. She told his fans at The Quint that she often wonders, “What if she had given him food when he asked? What if the timing was a few minutes before or after namaz?” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"15 December, 2023 ","Who is Shahrukh Pathan’s father: Convicted for 10 years over drug peddling, evidence of collusion with Pakistanis and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-is-shahrukh-pathan-father-convicted-10-years-drug-peddling-collusion-pakistani-delhi-riots/,"Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.On Wednesday (December 13th) Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi’s family was targeted and attackers attempted to burn his brother Mahesh Panchal alive by pouring thinner on him in the Dabua Colony in Haryana’s Faridabad. Within hours, victim Mahesh Panchal was transferred from three hospitals while in a critical condition. Mahesh has sustained severe burn injuries, estimated to be around 60%, and he is in critical condition. The next 72 hours, according to the doctors, will be crucial for the victim.As per the information received, the assailants who burned Mahesh first attempted to capture and burn him, but they were unsuccessful. Subsequently, they poured thinner on Mahesh and set him ablaze. Following this, the accused escaped. Mahesh dived into a drain right away, but the fire was not extinguished. He then took 3-4 dips, and the fire was quenched. After that, he walked to his house, which was around 800 metres away on his own as nobody came forward to help him. When finally Mahesh somehow reached his home, Bittu Bajrangi took him the the hospital. According to media reports, the attackers led by one Armaan first confirmed Bittu Bajrangi’s brother Mahesh Panchal’s identity. ‘Are you the brother of Bittu Bajrangi?’ they questioned Mahesh Panchal. When Mahesh said yes to this question, they poured thinner on him and set him ablaze.Arman Khan, the main accused in this case, has been arrested by police and is being interrogated. Meanwhile, the police have examined the crime scene. According to the report, the white WagonR used by the attackers had no registration number. Moreover, two bikes had followed him suspiciously to the location.Meanwhile, Bittu Bajrangi stated that Mahesh has been moved around three hospitals so far. First, it was the government hospital, then it was Santosh Hospital, and now it is Prachi Hospital. The doctors have said that the next 72 hours will be critical. Several members of Hindu organisations and local BJP MLAs visited the hospital to inquire about Mahesh’s well-being.Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.Bittu Bajrangi further stated that he had been receiving death threats for a long with those behind the threats asking him to “take his slippers back (Chappal lekar jao)”. The code ‘chappal’ was used by the perpetrators to remind Bajrangi about the slippers Hindus had left outside the temple when the Islamist mob attacked them during Nuh violence earlier this year.Bittu alleged that the attackers who attempted to kill his brother were all involved in the July 31 violence unleashed by Islamists in Haryana’s Nuh district. Bittu Bajrangi stated that the family sought an arms licence, but the administration refused. Not only that, but Bittu said, citing a police officer, that the person who issued the threats had also threatened a prominent Gurgaon businessman for ‘protection money’ adding that he is a seasoned criminal.Meanwhile, an OpIndia team arrived on the scene and found several police personnel stationed at the hospital. Several members of Hindu organisations also convened at the hospital. However, no one is permitted to meet with the victim. The police have imposed multiple sections in this case, including sections 147, 149, 307, and 326A. Arman, the accused, is being questioned by local police.Bittu Bajrangi told OpIndia that he is satisfied with the actions taken by the Faridabad Police in the matter so far. He has also urged people to refrain from engaging in any form of protest or unlawful activity.Bittu Bajrangi is a Hindu activist who raises his voice for the unity of Hindus. After the violence that erupted in Nuh in the Mewat region, his name gained more traction in the news. Subsequently, he was also arrested in a case of a clash with the police. At present, Bittu Bajrangi is out of jail on bail. In this case, all Hindu organisations supported him. Initially, the rumour spread rapidly that Bittu Bajrangi was associated with the Nuh violence, but the police made it clear that action was taken against Bittu Bajrangi not related to the Nuh violence, but in a different case of a clash with the police.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","‘They came in a vehicle with no number plates, set fire on Bittu Bajrangi’s brother’: Arman had earlier burned his own shop to blame...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bittu-bajrangis-brother-set-on-fire-arman-had-earlier-burned-his-own-shop-to-blame-hindus-says-activist/,"The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. ""There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,"" the letter reads. In a shocking case that has come to the fore from the Kondhwa region of Maharashtra’s Pune district, government land that had been earlier allotted for the construction of a playground is now being converted into a Muslim burial ground. This is after the former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe and BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar submitted a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) suggesting that the amenity space around some of the Hindu societies in Kondhwa could be the perfect location to build a burial ground (Qabristan) for the Muslim community.BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar later backtracked from the suggestion, reportedly after realising the problems of the locals and after he was informed about the issues in the area.  The letter claimed that the Kondhwa region in Pune has a large Muslim population and that it would be favorable for the community to have a burial ground nearby. Former Hadapsar @NCPspeaks MLA Chetan Tupe @ChetanVTupe n @BJP4Maharashtra leader Yogesh Tilekar @iYogeshTilekar recommended converting a Hindu-majority residential area's of #Kondhwa playground into a Muslim burial ground. Pune Municipal Corporation @PMCPune has spent 46 lakh… pic.twitter.com/AKS6vc0FfaSeveral Hindu societies around the said amenity space (survey no. 44) have complained to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) objecting to the construction of a burial ground for the Muslim community. “The societies around the plot are Hindu societies and several thousand Hindu families reside in this location. Several Hindu temples are also located in the area and building a burial ground for the Muslim community here might cause religious harm to the residents,” the letter by Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society read. The complaint dated 23rd October has been exclusively obtained by OpIndia upon which no action has been taken by the PMC yet. Similar complaint letters have been submitted by Achalnagar Sahakari Gruharachana Society Ltd and Shree Vardhaman Nagar Co-op Housing Society Ltd to the PMC highlighting that around 12000 to 15000 Hindu families reside in the locality and that it would be wrong to allow amenity space that was supposed to be a playground for a Muslim burial ground. The complaint letters obtained by OpIndia have been signed by all the society members who are Hindus. Amenity space is a portion of a building that adds convenience for all occupants of a building and that is not used exclusively by any one occupant. In the current case, the amenity space is just a wall close to societies that have registered complaints and the space is authoritatively looked after by the PMC. The controversy has been long-standing since the year 2021 when NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil submitted a letter to the PMC suggesting that the amenity space on survey no. 44 plot should be made a Muslim burial ground given that the Kondhwa region in Pune houses a large Muslim population. However, in between these years, it was later advised by the PMC’s Amenity Space Committee that a Muslim burial ground would be constructed in the amenity space on surveys no. 18 and 19 and that a playground would be constructed on survey no. 44 space. The Muslim community members then happened to press that a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be better given the closer distance and that the supposed burial ground in Survey no 18 and 19 space would cause commuting problems for the community. Several letters to PMC pressing their demand for survey no 44 space were sent by the Nagarsevak, Adv Abdul Gafar Pathan, Parveen Haji Firoz Sheikh, and former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil. The letters erroneously claimed that most of the population residing around the survey no. 44 plots were Muslims and it would be a feasible space for Muslim burial ground. A similar letter advocating for a Qabristan on survey no. 44 land was submitted by the BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar on 8th May 2023 to the PMC. The letter stated that survey no. 18 and 19 spaces were too far from the Muslim locality residing in Kondhwa and that making a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be feasible instead. The PMC on 16th May then approved the proposal based on the letter submitted by Tilekar. However, it has come to the fore that Tilekar submitted the letter after the local Muslim community members sought his help regarding the land issue. The Muslim community representatives informed Tilekar that a maximum of the Muslim population resides around survey no. 44 amenity space and that it should be converted into a Muslim burial ground. OpIndia talked to BJP MLA Yogesh Tilekar confirming the incident. He exclusively informed OpIndia that he was misinformed about the survey no. 44 spaces and the ongoing project of playground construction on the land. “I didn’t know the land was already allotted by the PMC for a playground construction. Neither did the local Muslim representatives tell me nor the PMC. The letter I sent in May 2023 pressed for a burial ground on survey no. 44 space. However, after I learned that the maximum of population residing around the survey no. 44 space is Hindu, I sent another letter demanding the cancellation of the allotment of the land for a Muslim burial ground,” Tilekar said while talking to OpIndia. The letter of cancellation that Tilekar sent to the PMC on 23rd October 2023 clearly states that the survey no. 44 amenity space is located in a crowded area and most of the population that resides in the societies around the space is Hindu. “I first thought that the area housed a large Muslim population but I was misinformed. Most of the population residing in the locality is Hindu,” the letter reads. The entire incident was exposed after an RTI activist Dr Paritosh Zaware Patil residing in the Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society (next to survey no 44 amenity space) filed an RTI demanding details of the location. It came to the fore that the PMC had already allotted the land for the construction of a playground and that the government had already spent Rs 43 lakhs for construction. Surprisingly, the land still is vacant and is under controversy over the Muslim burial ground construction. The land was allotted for the construction of the playground in the year 2017 and in 2019 grant of Rs 43 lakhs for the purpose was also obtained. The project of construction of the playground was given to some Salim Construction in the year 2019 and Rs 49 lakhs had been spent for the purpose. “The land is still vacant and no playground has been constructed here. Instead, they want to make a Muslim burial ground here. This is a crowded locality and we don’t want our children to see anything that would not be good for their age,” Dr Patil confirmed. Dr. Paristosh Patil while talking to OpIndia confirmed that survey no 18 and 19 are in the East part of the Kondhwa region and that it still stands vacant. “Some people had demanded that a vegetable market should be developed there. However, in the Amenity space committee meeting, the PMC denied the permission. That land can easily be converted into a Muslim burial ground. No problem at all. But the Muslim community members want survey no 44 amenity space only which is located in the crowded Hindu locality. They say that it is a closer option for them.” Patil added that he or the other society members have nothing to do with the community. “We are not against the Muslim community. Our problem is the burial ground. How can it be constructed in a densely crowded residential locality? All our society’s flat doors face the ground and families stay with us. What if our children ask tomorrow about the burials? Like what it is and why does this happen? Many children residing in the society are too young to see this. Even if there was a demand for Hindu cremation ground, we would have opposed it,” he added. The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. “There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,” the letter reads. The complaint also says that constructing a Muslim burial ground might create health hazards. “Water used for the process might seep into the society pipes causing health hazards. The societies and the survey no 44 amenity space are just a wall away from each other,” Dr Patil confirmed. Team OpIndia also talked to some of the other society residents to know about the Muslim burial ground being constructed on the nearby premises. One of the Raviraj Colorado society residents stated that several unknown persons are calling the society residents after the complaint to the PMC saying the Muslim burial ground will be built on survey no. 44 land come what may. “People are threatening us and saying that the inauguration of the burial ground will be executed in January next year. We all are scared and don’t want to see people getting buried there,” said Neelam Shah, one of the residents (name changed for security reasons). She further added that several Hindu organizations and concerned legal committees are looking into the case and people here are even ready to protest. “The roadway to the ground is really narrow as the locality is already crowded. Single lanes lead to the ground in question. School buses also pass through the same routes. Imagine now if someone dies from their community (God forbid) and they get the body to the ground for burial and then there’s also a bus passing through the same route.. our children will be forced to see what they should not at this age? Moreover, the traffic issues might also increase. The Muslim burial ground here is a bad idea,” she pressed. Neelam further added that the amenity space which is vacant at present is used by some of the miscreants to carry out immoral and illegal activities. On asking about the ‘immoral activities’, Shah said that people use the site for drinking and all wrong purposes after the evening hours. “This also should stop,” she demanded.The resident also added that some of the people living in the societies are leaving their properties and selling at a loss due to the increasing influence of the Muslim community. “The Muslim burial ground is making people leave their hard-earned homes. This is not done,” she adds. Another resident Jyotsna Patil (name changed for security reasons) also confirmed that most of the population staying here in the Kondhwa region is Hindu. “The burial ground can result in severe health hazards. Not instantly but in the coming 4-5 years people will notice changes in the environment here and their health to be specific. This is hazardous. Also, this is a Hindu community crowded space. Religiously, it would be incorrect to have another community burial ground here. Strict action should be taken in this case,” Patil said. The PMC is said to have taken action based on the letter submitted by BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar. However, Tilekar stated that he was misinformed about the location and that no he is ready to do anything to stop the ‘playground’ being converted into a Muslim burial ground. Reportedly, the Amenity Space Committee of Pune Municipal Corporation has taken no action on the cancellation request submitted by the BJP MLA. The decision shall be taken in the upcoming meeting of the body. At present, the amenity space contains a jogging track and a few rest places. The remaining portion of the land stands vacant. It is important to note that Pune’s Kondhwa region has been in the news for some time. In July this year, the National Investigation Agency arrested a doctor from the Kondhwa region for sheltering ISIS members. Also, three residents from the Mithanagar area of Kondhwa had been arrested by NIA for promoting terrorist activities at the behest of the global terrorist outfit Islamic State (IS). Later, in August, it had come to the fore that the accused ISIS operatives organized and participated in bomb-making workshops in Pune’s Kondhwa area in 2022. The central investigation agency received credible intelligence that these accused and their associates were recruiting youth and training them to make Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and weapons. They also shared Do It Yourself (DIY) kits and other relevant materials among themselves for creating IEDs and manufacturing small weapons, pistols, and more. Notably, the accused were also involved in creating content for the pro-ISIS magazine ‘Voice of Hind’. The online magazine led to several raids by the NIA in October 2021 in Kashmir. On 5th August, the accused were sent to ATS custody by a Pune court. ATS informed the court they found incriminating material from the accused, including an Indian map with several cities marked, laptops containing material to study the modus operandi of terror attacks, and more. The initial probe revealed they have links to the Al Sufa module. However, a later investigation revealed they all were part of ISIS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

This is why Parliament is getting adjourned repeatedly,” Jairam Ramesh said.Rajya Sabha has also witnessed repeated adjournments on the issue. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

It must be mentioned that Bengalis have a history of resisting the imposition of non-native languages particularly Urdu. Watch the video👇 pic.twitter.com/sXzRjE4yuBIn fact, one of the reasons leading up to the Bangladesh Liberation War was the imposition of Urdu over Bengali in then-East Pakistan. As such, the prophecy by Kolkata Mayor that half of the State of West Bengal will one day speak in Urdu was meant to spark controversy. The viral video of Firhad Hakim was recorded on 11th February 2021 during an event hosted by the West Bengal Urdu Academy.During the event dubbed ‘Mushaira 2021’, he was heard saying, “There was a time when Urdu speakers did not feel like they belonged to Bengal. There was no official status for Urdu. I want to thank Mamata Banerjee for making Urdu the second official language of Bengal.”“We have increased the budget of the Urdu Academy to ₹15 crore,” he informed. Firhad Hakim said that his ancestors came from Bihar and spoke Urdu at home. He also called upon the West Bengal Urdu Academy to take measures to propagate the language in the State of West Bengal.It must be mentioned that Mamata Banerjee engaged in appeasement politics soon after becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2011. A year later in February 2012, she made Urdu the second language in areas of the State where Urdu speakers were equal to or more than 10% of the population.The Trinamool Congress government had identified a total of 18 such Urdu-speaking areas -Goalpokhar I and II blocks, Islalmpur block, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Islampur Municipality, Garulia Municipality, Titagarh Municipality, Kamarhati Municipality, Bhatpara Municipality, Champdani Municipality, Bansberia Municipality, Bhadreswar Municipality, Rishra Municipality, Asansol Municipal Corporation, Jamuria Municipality, Raniganj Municipality, Kulti Municipality and Bally Municipality.However, this is not the first time when the Mayor of Kolkata has been in the news for the wrong reasons. In April 2016, he had dubbed a Muslim-dominated area of Kolkata as ‘Mini-Pakistan‘ In February 2021, he was spotted delivering a political speech at a masjid in Kolkata, in blatant violation of the Model Code of Conduct. To pacify Muslim rioters during the anti-CAA movement, Firhad Hakim referred to them as ‘brothers.’ The Kolkata Mayor was earlier seen referring to the Central Armed forces and the BJP as ‘Suar er baccha‘ (progency of pigs).Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He said that such deliberate actions of the Chief Minister precipitate the breakdown of constitutional machinery.Coming down heavily on Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday accused him of attempting to disrupt the peaceful ambience in the state. Speaking to reporters, Vijayan said, “Arif Mohammad Khan is making a move to destroy the peaceful ambience of Kerala.”After facing a black-flag protest from members of the SFI, the students’ wing of the ruling CPI(M), the Governor claimed an attempt on his life.However, the chief minister said the governor’s actions were such that they sparked protests.CM Vijayan further highlighted the comments made by former Supreme Court justice Rohinton Nariman in a public event in Mumbai, outlining the “wholesale reference to the President,” of Bills by the Kerala governor.Vijayan further accused the governor of allegedly accepting proposals from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which, according to him, resulted in the student protests. The chief minister opposed his actions, calling them “totally wrong.”Also drawing attention to the Governor’s choice of words, Vijayan questioned how he could use such harsh language. He also expressed concern over the Governor’s approach towards individuals, who showed him black flags. He termed the action as ‘provocative’.Earlier, SFI (Students Federation of India), the student wing of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), staged a black-flag protest march to Calicut University, ahead of the Governor’s arrival on campus.Black banners and posters were put up outside Calicut University Guest House where the Governor was staying. The protesters were, however, removed from the spot by the police on the instruction of the Governor’s office.A statement from Raj Bhavan mentioned that the Governor took serious note of the action of the state police, on the direction of the Chief Minister, in placing posters defamatory to him on the campus of Calicut University.The Governor earlier claimed that the police were prevented from acting against ‘criminals’. He also accused CM Vijayan of hatching a conspiracy to harm him.“This is not a question of my comment, as I said in the morning. It is about law. We are a democratic republic and the law must prevail. The police stood like silent bystanders while the protesters were at it. It was because of political reasons that they stood by idly. My car was surrounded and the protesters banged on it with all the force that they could muster,” the Governor said.He added that he was not scared of anyone. “Due to political reasons, the Kerala Police were prevented from acting against these rowdies and criminals. I believe in facing up to brutes. I am not scared of anyone,” he added. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

On 17th December (Sunday), Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said that the Supreme Court’s 11th December ruling on Article 370 is not a “God’s verdict”. Speaking with reporters in Kupwara, she asserted that her party, PDP will continue to struggle for the restoration of special status to Jammu and Kashmir.Mufti said, “We don’t have to lose heart. We will continue our struggle. The Supreme Court is not God. The same Supreme Court had earlier said that Article 370 cannot be amended without the recommendation of a constituent assembly. They were also learned judges. Today some other judges passed the ruling. We cannot treat it as God’s verdict.”#WATCH | On Supreme Court verdict on Article 370 in J&K, PDP Chief Mehbooba Mufti says, ""…Supreme Court's verdict is not God's verdict, we will not lose hope and will continue our fight."" pic.twitter.com/iDpFN7TWDWShe claimed that those who oppose special status to Jammu and Kashmir, want “us to give up” on our fight. The PDP President stressed that they will not lose hope and continue the fight in this regard. She added, “Our opponents want us to give up the fight but we will continue till our last breath. We have made a lot of sacrifices and we cannot let them go in vain.” Previously, the PDP leader had described the apex court’s verdict on pleas challenging the abrogation of Article 370 as a “death sentence” not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the idea of India. Stating that the struggle in the region has been a political fight spanning several decades, Mufti had urged people not to lose hope.  Likewise, Omar Abdullah, the vice-president of the National Conference, conveyed his disappointment over Article 370 article. Dil na umeed tou nahi ⁰Na kaam hi tou hai ⁰Lambi hai gham ki shaam⁰Magar shaam hi tou haiIt is important to note that both the valley leaders who have been actively seen indulging in political activities had earlier claimed that they were house-arrested by the LG administration in the wake of the Article 370 verdict. They had also alleged that were they not allowed to talk with reporters. However, the claim was immediately rejected by Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha and Srinagar Police calling their allegations “totally baseless”.On 11th December, the Supreme Court of India upheld the Centre’s decision to abrogate Article 370 which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The five-judge constitutional bench noted that J&K did not retain any sovereignty after the instrument of accession was signed and there is no internal sovereignty for Jammu and Kashmir. It also ruled that Article 370 was a temporary provision. The court also asked the Election Commission to conduct the election to the Union Territory’s Assembly by September 30 next year.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-led government at the Centre under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked Article 370, taking away the special status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir on 5th August 2019.

"14 December, 2023 ","Ashok Gehlot ruined Rajasthan’s economy, left a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore on the state, failed to boost GDP",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ashok-gehlot-rajasthans-economy-left-a-debt-of-rs-5-37-lakh-crore-on-the-state-failed-to-boost-gdp/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"13 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai who admitted that they were like vultures. On the 13th of December 2023, there was a serious security breach in the Parliament of India. Two individuals hurled a smoke canister from the viewer gallery. They then jumped to the floor of the house and were trying to make their way towards the speaker when were overpowered by parliamentarians. Thereafter they were detained by the police and taken for interrogation. Just as the security breach took place, there were two individuals outside the parliament protesting with similar colour smoke canisters. According to preliminary information from the Delhi Police, there is no terror angle to the incidents, however, the police are taking the breach seriously. According to reports, the intruder inside the parliament was chanting slogans about “Kaala Kanoon” and the protestors outside the Parliament were chanting slogans like Jai Bhim, Tanashahi Nahi Chalegi, Manipur ko Insaf do, etc. While the country was shocked by the serious security breach and the ramifications of the lapse, Indian media was conducting their very own circus. A video emerged where TV journalists were seen fighting like animals over the smoke canister that was hurled by the protestors. In the video put out by TV9, their journalist was showing the smoke canister on camera. While he was doing his segment, other journalists started trying to snatch the canister saying that he had used it enough and should hand over the canister to other journalists. When the other journalists started trying to snatch the canister, the TV9 journalist was seen almost sprinting with it, trying to get a few more seconds with the canister – for the sake of the hard-hitting coverage of the unfolding incident at the Parliament. As the nation had important questions that the media should have been focussing on – like how this security breach took place, who were the intruders, what were they chanting, why they did what they did, what was the police doing and how visitors entered the parliament with canisters and why were the Delhi Police so lackadaisical in arrested the protestors outside the Parliament, almost looking like they were taking them for a walk, these elements in the media seemed far more interested in ridiculous sensationalism and showing visuals of the canister. While we watched this circus unfold, there are several important aspects that people need to be extremely worried about. First and foremost, one has to wonder about the priorities of the media and what they choose to cover when important events unfold. As mentioned, there are very important questions that need to be answered as this security breach unfolds. The Parliament is not just a building but a symbol of the democracy of India and the seat of power. Any attack on the Parliament is an attack on democracy and the sovereignty of India itself. While these events unfolded, the journalists on the ground should have been far more focused on bringing crucial details to the people of the nation. And while several journalists were doing so, some were indulging in cheap sensationalism. This, however, comes as no surprise. One is reminded of the time when Rajdeep Sardesai was talking about the 2001 Parliament Attack – the terrorist attack that incidentally took place on this day 22 years ago. In 2018, a video had gone viral where Rajdeep Sardesai admitted that journalists were vultures. Sardesai in the video recounted the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament where he and his crew were preparing for a picnic owing to a slow news day. Preparing for a feast in the garden near the Parliament, he and his team entered the Parliament at around 11 am. Within minutes of the team entering the Parliament, he says they heard gunshots. The Parliament was attacked. He then recalled that when his colleague asked him to leave, he directed him to suggest the guard to close the gates. He explained with a wide grin that he did so so that no other channel crew could enter. Those days there were fewer channels and Sardesai was excited at the prospect of doing an exclusive story.He then says how the exclusive story of the parliament attack made the team forget the wine and kababs they were planning to picnic on. “It was a great day. We are like vultures. We feed on these moments.” he added.If one truly thinks about it, the current TV journalists are merely following the standards set by veteran vultures like Rajdeep Sardesai. While the conduct of the media was abysmal, what is far more concerning is the conduct of the Delhi Police and security agencies. When a security breach like this has taken place, one would imagine that the police and law enforcement agencies would ask the media to stand back – after all, 26/11 was a classic case of how the media could potentially jeopardise any rescue operation and investigation when such incidents take place. During the Mumbai Attack, the police allowed unbridled access to the media, resulting in journalists like Barkha Dutt potentially giving away crucial information on hostages from ISI handlers who were closely monitoring the media. Taking a lesson from the past, the police should have summarily kept the media away. That canister itself could be crucial evidence that the police need, instead, the media was yet again given unbridled access to play with the canister as if were some sort of a prop in a drama. On the 22nd anniversary of the ghastly 2001 Parliament attack, the parliament was under severe threat. There were Khalistani and other terror organisations which had issued threats against the Parliament. While now the police are claiming that the smoke was not harmful, while the breach was ongoing, the police had to function under the assumption that it could be a deadly terror attack which could have dire ramifications. Despite that, the media was given unbridled access knowing fully well that such media has a history of creating a circus during serious incidents. Several other questions are being raised against the police as the Parliament’s security was breached. Visitors to the Parliament are frisked at every stage and there are now questions being asked as to how the security could have been so wanting that two individuals with smoke canisters could enter the Parliament. Per protocol, those who have passes to view the Parliament proceedings are not allowed to carry a paper inside the Parliament. Legitimate concerns are now being raised as to how, amid such tight security, two individuals could enter with these canisters. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ","As TV reporters shamelessly fight for smoke canister thrown in Parliament, here are a few things we should all be worried about after witnessing...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/journalists-fight-colour-canister-parliament-few-things-we-should-be-worried-about/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","‘Islam is incompatible with Europian culture’: 5-year-old video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni goes viral, reported as recent statement",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/islam-is-incompatible-with-europian-culture-5-year-old-video-of-italian-pm-giorgia-meloni-goes-viral-fact-check/,"In the video, Meloni is seen saying, ""Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.""on 17th and 18th December, a video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni went viral on social media. As per the subtitles in the video, she was seen saying that Islam is not compatible with European values and culture. Islam is being perpetrated (in Italy) through Saudi Arabia’s funding and Saudi Arabia has Sharia law. Meloni further says that the Sharia law is not compatible with Europian values and culture. The whole of Europe is being Islamised.There is no similarity between our culture and Islam.Islam is being spread by Saudi in Italy.There is Sharia law in Saudi, which we will not allow to be implemented in Italy.: Georgia Meloni, PM, Italy pic.twitter.com/uCqYhpodBuThe same alleged statement was reported by a number of media houses, mostly Indian. ""यूरोप में हमारी सभ्यता के मूल्यों से बहुत दूर इस्लामीकरण की एक प्रक्रिया चल रही है.""◆ इटली की प्रधानमंत्री जॉर्जिया मेलोनी ने कहा #Europe #Islam | #GeorgiaMeloni pic.twitter.com/VRiLgytMfsMany media portals reported that her statement came after the recent political festival held in Italy by her party, The Brothers of Italy party, where UK PM Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk were also in attendance. A number of Indian media houses including WION, Hindustan Times, Mint, NDTV, and Times Now reported the same claims. NDTV used a X post embed of a handle named Geopolitical Kid and wrote that Meloni’s statement was given during the political event organised by her party. However, Meloni’s statement regarding Islam’s alleged incompatibility wasn’t found in any international publications in the last 24-hour window. Radio Genoa, a popular handle on X, seemed to have first posted the video. Italian PM Giorgia Meloni: “I believe that there is a problem of compatibility between Islamic culture and the values ​​and rights of our civilization. The Islamic cultural centers in Italy are financed by Saudi Arabia where Sharia is in force. In Europe there is a very… pic.twitter.com/wEn8Fl4JC2However, Radio Genoa has not cited a time frame, and has not written that Meloni’s statement was recent. Upon searching with the keywords and comparing it with Meloni’s video clip going viral, we found that the original video was posted on YouTube back in 2018. The video was posted by the YouTube channel alanews in 2018. The original video can be seen here. In the video, Meloni is seen saying, “Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.”In that video, Meloni was referring to a previous statement by another conservative leader Matteo Salvini. Salvini, referring to the Cologne mass sexual attacks and Berlin terrorist attack, had said that Islam is incompatible with European values. Salvni is a leader of Italy’s Lega Nord party. Conclusion: While the viral video of Giorgia Meloni is mostly correct in rough translation, the video, or the statement, are not recent. They are from 5 years ago, and not from the recent political event organised by Meloni’s party. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did Pakistani caretaker PM confirm that unknown men poisoned Dawood Ibrahim? Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-check-pakistani-caretaker-pm-dawood-ibrahim-death-confirmation/,"Dawood Ibrahim was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. On Monday (18th December), social media was abuzz with rumours of the death of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, who has been hiding in Pakistan for decades. As per the rumours, Ibrahim was poisoned by an unknown person, and he was rushed to hospital. Some posts on social media claimed he was critical, while others claimed that he died. The rumours began spreading on Sunday (17th December) after Pakistan’s internet went down.Amid the rumours, an alleged screenshot of caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar Ul Haq Kakar, went viral on social media with claims that the said post confirmed the death of Ibrahim. The post read, “The Messiah of humanity, dear to every Pakistani heart, our beloved His Excellency Dawood Ibrahim passed away due to poisoned by unknown. He breathed his last in a hospital in Karachi. May Allah grant him the highest position in Jannat. Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.”However, when OpIndia investigated the screenshot and the official handle of the Pakistani PM, we found that there was no such tweet. Furthermore, the handle used in the screenshot was anwaar_kakkar, while the real ID of the Pakistani PM is anwaar_kakar. There is a handle called anwaar_kakkar, but that is a fan account of PM Kakar, and there was no such tweet either. It was evident that someone artificially created the post by adding text and a Grey Verified Check Mark on the fan account.Pakistani journalists also fuelled the rumours. In a recent episode of Bheja Fry, Pakistani journalist Aarzoo Kazmi talked about the rumours surrounding the poisoning of Dawood Ibrahim and his critical health in the hospital. She highlighted the fact that there was an internet shutdown in the country and emphasised that something was happening in Pakistan. She also talked about the rumours of Dawood Ibrahim’s poisoning and critical health. While she fanned the rumours, the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed.As per Aaj Tak, Ibrahim was indeed admitted to the hospital two days back. It is unclear what was the reason, but several reports talked about the rumours of him being poisoned.Though the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed, it was indeed a fact that internet services faced a massive crackdown in Pakistan on 17th December. Social media services and search engines stopped working without any prior notice. No one could access social media platforms like X, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and the Google search engine was down. While it was rumoured that the crackdown was because of the poisoning of Ibrahim, in reality, it appeared that the Pakistani government shut down the internet to limit the access and circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer in Mumbai. It is believed that he now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.While Ibrahim’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refused to accept his presence in the country.OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The X users circulated the visuals from the Gomti bridge with misleading claims that the authority scattered their goods and assaulted the vendors. However, they were immediately fact-checked by the Lucknow Police. Spinning Police action as oppression of the poor, Asif Khan tweeted, “Poor Kashmiri dry fruit vendors were harassed by Lucknow Municipality team.

VIP movement traverses through this route because of which the  Municipal corporation and police regularly carry out anti-encroachment drives.”Misleading. @zoo_bear won't share that – vendors were asked to vacate no-vending zone several times before.

He added that the corporation had taken action previously, and the police had communicated with the vendors. East DCP Lucknow mentioned that today (17th December), the convoy of UP CM Yogi Adityanath also passed through this route. He added that today the dry fruit vendors showed indecency with the anti-encroachment team. Subsequently, when the police came to learn about the incident, they used the necessary force and brought the youths to the police station. They have been informed that this is a VIP route adding that they should cooperate with the anti-encroachment drives in the future as well.It is also notable that while the X users claimed police threw away the dry fruits being sold by the street vendors, others have said that the vendors themselves dropped the products on the streets after police asked them to vacate the place. Therefore, the police removed the street vendors not because of their identities as Kashmiris, but only because they were vending at an unauthorised place.

On 18th December (Monday), the Times of India commemorated the birth anniversary of Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin describing him as ‘The Man of Steel’.

CPI(M)’s Puducherry unit praising the Communist dictator wrote, “Comrade Joseph Stalin, born on December 18, 1878, a revolutionary Bolshevik who led the victorious Antifascist war and laid the foundation for a strong working-class state of the planet.

Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labour camps, forced collectivisation, famine and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women.In a century, communist states have killed approximately 100 million people, according to Ilya Somin’s articles. Joseph Stalin’s attempts to collectivise agriculture and production in Russia resulted in the deaths of 6 to 10 million people. Stalin imposed collective agriculture, prohibiting people from cultivating on their own, and imprisoning dissenters in Siberian labour camps. In Russia and Ukraine, millions went hungry, and hundreds of thousands died in prison camps. When Ukrainian production fell short of Stalin’s quota, he punished them even more by taking away everything they had. In Ukraine, Stalin’s forced famine is termed ‘Holodomor’ by joining the words for hunger (holod) and mor (extermination or mass-murder).Stalin’s atrocities were not restricted to the Soviet famine; he also carried out the ‘Great Purge,’ in which everyone he disapproved of was imprisoned, tortured, or executed. No one was spared, even wealthy peasants, politicians, military men, and ethnic minorities. The Purge alone is thought to have killed over 1.2 million people.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"17 December, 2023 ","Party wanted to deny him ticket, those who helped him are dead or in BJP: Rajdeep Sardesai tries to defend Congress over scam accused...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/rajdeep-sardesai-defends-congress-it-raids-dhiraj-prasad-sahu-controversy/,"""Among his key benefactors is someone who is no longer alive and held the purse strings of the Congress for a very long time. Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,"" Sardesai had claimed.Days after the Income Tax (IT) Department recovered a whopping ₹353 crore from the offices of Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai came to the rescue of the Congress MP.In a video posted on his YouTube channel on Friday (16th December), Sardesai claimed that the scam-tainted politician had no chance of being a Parliamentarian. While citing a make-believe ‘source’, he alleged that the Congress wanted to deny Sahu a ticket to the Rajya Sabha in 2018. The controversial ‘journalist’ claimed that the party relented after leaders, who have now defected to the BJP, lobbied for him. He also made reference to a ‘dead’ Congress leader who supposedly influenced the decision of the party to send Dhiraj Prasad Sahu to the Rajya Sabha.At a time when the grand-old-party is under scanner over allegations of corruption, Rajdeep Sardesai was seen making a last-ditch effort to give a clean chit to the Congress’ high command.“A senior Congress leader from Jharkhand claims Sahu was to be denied a ticket in 2018 but he reportedly managed to get his Rajya Sabha nomination at the very last moment with the help of a very key people in the Congress hierarchy in the National Capital,” he was heard saying.“Among his key benefactors is someone who is no longer alive and held the purse strings of the Congress for a very long time. Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,” Sardesai brazened out.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress from Jharkhand. His family has been associated with the Congress party since independence. He became RS MP in by-polls in 2009 for the first time. In 2010, he was elected as RS MP for the second time; in 2018, he was re-elected for RS by Congress for the third time. He actively participates in parliamentary proceedings. Sahu was part of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra. In recent raids at Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd, where Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner, the Income Tax Department recovered ₹353 cr of unaccounted cash. Congress Party has distanced itself from the controversy.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"14 December, 2023 ","News24 posts misleading tweet on Muslim sculptors making idol of Ram Lalla, here are the facts on the idols being made for the Ram...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/news24-posts-misleading-tweet-on-muslim-sculptors-making-idol-of-ram-lalla/,"While Muslim sculptor Jamaluddin and his son are making fibre statues of Lord Ram for decorative purposes, News24 claimed they are making Ram Lalla idol to be placed in Ram MandirAs the date for grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya approaches, various updates about the temple are being reported by the media. However, misleading and fake news are also being published by some media houses regarding the Ram Mandir. One such false information was provided by News24, which claimed that the idol of Ram Lalla to be installed in the temple is being made by a Muslim sculptor and his son.On 14th December, News24 posted a tweet on X, claiming that Muhammad Jamaluddin from West Bengal and his son Bittu are sculpting the idol of Ram Lalla, which will take its place in the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The tweet in Hindi said, “Ramlalla is ready to sit in the Ram temple of Ayodhya in January.” After that, the media houses added four bullet points, the first of which said, “The idols were made by Mohammad Jamaluddin of Bengal and his son Bittu.”News24 then said in the post that father-son duo has been crafting idols for a long time. The post then added remarks by Jamaluddin, who said, ‘Religion is a personal thing. People following many religions live in our country. The culture of brotherhood is my message as an artiste.’By saying that Jamaluddin and his son are making the idol of Ram Lall to be placed in Ram Mandir, News24 implied that the Muslim duo is making the main idol to placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. But this is completely fake and misleading claim, and no Muslim is making the main idol of Ram Lalla.In fact, other media reports on Jamaluddin make it clear that he is making a decorating idol using fibre for the opening ceremony of Ram Mandir. As per a report by India Today, Mohammed Jamaluddin and his son Bittu have been engaged in creating some statues that will adorn the temple complex. The report stated that he is making life-size fibre statues.Other reports make it clear that the fibre statutes of Lord Ram and other Gods will be used to decorate the temple complex and the Ayodhya City during the inauguration ceremony. TV9 reported that statues of Lord Ram will be placed in major intersections in Ayodhya, and some of these idols are being made by Jamaluddin and his son.After several social media users pointed out the misleading claim made by News24, the media house later deleted the tweet.Fibre idols are generally used for decorative purposes, and they are not used as the main deity in temples. Most deities in Hindu temples are made from various types of stones, while temporary idols made for annual festivals are made using clay. Fibre idols last longer than clay, but are much easier to make compared to carving stone. Fibre idols are generally made for export, as they are lighter and easy to transport with the risk of damage. Notably, not one but three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya by three separate artists, and one of them will be picked by a committee to be placed in Sanctum Santorum, after which the pran pratistha rituals will be conducted by priests. Champat Rai, general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, had earlier informed that the three different idols are being made by three sculptors – Ganesh Bhatt and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka and Satyanarayan Pandey from Jaipur. Two of the idols are being made using two stones from Karnataka and one from Rajasthan. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable.Ganesh Bhatt of Karnataka is carving out the idol from Nellikaru rock or black stones which is also known as Shyam shila or Krishna shila. Famous sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Mysore, who sculpted the 12-ft statue of Adi Shankaracharya unveiled by PM Modi in Kedarnath, is sculpting another idol using another rock from Karnataka. Satya Narayan Pandey of Rajasthan is carving the Ram Lalla idol from white Makrana marble stones. All three artists are chiselling the idols based on a sketch by renowned artist Vasudeo Kamath from Mumbai.The 51-inch-tall Ram Lalla depicts the child form of Lord Ram, same as the current smaller idol that was placed in the makeshift temple for over half a century. The idol will depict five-year-old Ram Lalla sitting on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Many other symbols related to Lord Ram will carved on the statue.While one idol will be selected to be permanently placed in the sanctum sanctorum, the other two idols will be placed in prominent places inside the temple premises.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"14 December, 2023 ","N Ram pats his own back for a pompous, gassy editorial in The Hindu, The Wire has a monumental meltdown: Fallout of SC decision...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/n-ram-pompous-editorial-the-hindu-the-wire-meltdown-sc-decision-article-370/,"N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise.On December 11th, the Supreme Court upheld the abolition of the dreaded Article 370 (I know it was repealed and therefore while Article 370 still exists in the Constitution, the original dreaded purpose for which it was intended doesn’t exist anymore). Certain sections of the English media; certain sections of the I.N.D.I alliance and the entire Congress party went bonkers over this decision of the Supreme Court. Watching their meltdowns gave me goosebumps, literally. Am sure that their WhatsApp groups buzzed with messages on what should be their best strategy on this topic. The line of argument they have chosen to bombard their readers/viewers is – Attack on Federalism! A long, pompous and gassy editorial was published in his newspaper, The Hindu (we will get it later in this article). N. Ram showed utmost humility and described his editorial as “clear-sighted and insightful”. A former CEO of The Hindu group of publications, Rajiv C. Lochan, dared to call out this humility of N.Ram on Twitter here (“Beware when one pats one’s own back”. He went on to comment that “the pervasive use of adjectives can’t strengthen a relatively weak set of arguments”. Rajiv Lochan was telling N. Ram that just because he used good English doesn’t mean that this editorial is insightful. Now, the unparalleled arrogance of N. Ram is well known. Occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove it yet again to all his readers. Rajiv Lochan provided the best opportunity for N. Ram to exhibit his famed arrogance and intolerance in public. True to his image, N. Ram use a lot of English words to convey a simple meaning. I would urge you to read the image below and have a hearty laugh at N. Ram’s meltdown! He is telling Rajiv Lochan that a mere CEO should shut up because there is no one better than N.Ram to have opinions in this whole world. How can a mere CEO comment in public about matters as trivial as Article 370? Imagine N. Ram’s attitude towards mere citizens if he goes bombastic like this on his former CEO! After reading the “clear-sighted and insightful” editorial about 3 to 5 times, I was able to find 2 sentences that summarized the arguments of the entire English media gang. The title of the editorial makes it sound like doomsday is near and we will die because of what the Supreme Court did! I have highlighted the relevant portion in the editorial that tells us that Parliament can now do anything while keeping a state under the President’s rule. This was what his compatriots at The Wire were also shrieking about. The meltdown at The Wire was even more monumental in proportions. Multiple opinion pieces popped up in a short time – all telling us the same thing – that there is no difference left between “democracy and dictatorship”; that there are “Serious implications” for the entire country; that this is an “attack on the basic structure of federalism”; and the best of all – Many “locals had feared” that they have been pushed into “meaningful silence”!Think about what these people are writing folks. What is wrong with “meaningful silence”? What is wrong with anything that is classified as “meaningful”? How can you use the word “meaningful” as a consequence of having “fear” to want it? N.Ram, Siddarth Varadarajan and their ilk know very well that the Parliament can split or not split a state even when there is an elected government in place and the legislature wishes otherwise. When she was the CM of UP, Mayawati passed a resolution in the UP Assembly asking the centre to split into 4 states. The then Home Minister flatly rejected the resolution. The disastrous manner in which AP was split into TS and AP is still fresh in many minds. The AP Legislature resolved that the state should not be split. Did that stop Sonia Gandhi from taking a stand otherwise? Examples galore exist on this topic. Starting from 1956 when their hero Nehru suspended the first elected communist government in the world in Kerala using a “brute majority” in Parliament. We can further discuss the language of Articles 1,2 and 3 in the Constitution of India. It wouldn’t serve any purpose for these people. We are approaching 10 years of Modi government. Despite their wonderful knowledge of the English language, these editors and owners have not been able to find new words, in the past 10 years, to describe their contempt towards the people of India for electing Modi. By rehashing the same words, and in the garb of being “insightful” and “clear-sighted”, all that these people have succeeded in was to show us how blinded they are to the reality of a new emerging Bharat. A Bharat that will embrace all meaningful decisions and leave behind all the meaningless trash these people dish out every day. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Musk wrote, “I’m literally rofl rn.” Indian American businessman and GOP Presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy faced an embarrassing moment when he forgot to mute his mic while taking a ‘loo break’ from an active X (Twitter) space. Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform. However, interjecting in the conversation, Ramaswamy conveyed that he would have to take a short break, hurriedly stating, “Gentlemen, I have to go.” While Elon Musk continued the discussion, the unmistakable sound of running water could be heard in the background.Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy takes a piss with his mic on during an 𝕏 Space with 100K+ listenersElon Musk: “I hope you feel better”Vivek: “I feel great, thank you” pic.twitter.com/3ljslTqnpXPointing towards unusual noises, Alex Jones sarcastically remarked, “Someone’s got their thing open peeing. Somebody’s got their phone in the bathroom.” Responding to Jones’ remark, the host Mario Nawfal alerted Ramaswamy that the source of the noise was his phone. Nawfal said, “Vivek, that’s your phone. But I am not able to mute you.” On returning from the short break, Vivek Ramaswamy realised that his mic was unmuted and understood what had transpired. He immediately apologised for the embarrassing moment. However, on a lighter note, Musk quips, “I hope you feel better now”. To which Ramaswamy replied, “I feel great. Sorry about that guys.”While the awkward moment was initially met with stunned silence, it sparked a flurry of witty reactions. Musk later responded to the post that had caught the incident stating that he was bursting into uncontrollable laughter.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed a gun at a policeman during the anti-Hindu riots in North-East Delhi in 2020, was refused regular bail by a Delhi court on 14th December. The court stated it observed no need to grant him bail and Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat of Karkardooma Court noted, “Considering the conduct of the accused Shahrukh Pathan in jail during his judicial custody, his conduct prior to his being arrested, conduct during court proceedings and most importantly, the allegations against the accused which are being supported by the eyewitnesses and also the video footage, on any of the counts on which bail can be considered, the court sees nothing to set him enlarged on bail.”The bail order made several revelations about Shahrukh Patha,n the case and the remorseless conduct of Pathan after he was arrested, based on the evidence provided by the prosecution which was accepted by the court. The case pertains to the infamous picture where Shahrukh Pathan was seen holding a gun to a police officer’s head during the Delhi anti-hindu riots. During the riot, on the 24th of February 2020, a confrontation broke out between Jaffrabad Metro Station and Maujpur Bridge. There were more than 5,000 people who came face to face in that area. The anti-CAA protestors (Islamist mob) were pelting stones and brandishing guns. When the investigation was carried out, 3 cartridges were found at the spot where Shahrukh Pathan brandished a gun, aimed at the head of a police officer in uniform. The order details how Shahrukh Pathan first fired a few rounds at the crowd and refused to pay heed to the warnings issued by the police officer. When he advanced, for the safety of the crowd, the police officer stood in his path and did not move. When Pathan was at a distance of 9-10 feet from the police officer, he fired his weapon aimed at the police officer’s head to kill him. The police officer dodged the bullet but continued to stand there in his path so he couldn’t advance further and kill the Hindus. As the police officer refused to move, Pathan pushed the officer and then aimed the gun at his head again. When the police officer issued another warning after being pushed, Shahrukh Pathan fired at the crowd and started retreating. It was only after sustained interrogation that Shahrukh Pathan revealed his full identity and confessed to his involvement in the crime. The prosecution has also argued that Shahrukh Pathan was not only attempting to kill the police officer but was also leading the mob. Interestingly, the order reveals how Shahrukh Pathan was not cooperative during the investigation and refused to reveal the identity of other rioters who were involved. During the investigation, it is detailed, that Pathan also tried his best to mislead the police. He has also displayed aggressive and remorseless conduct in jail. The prosecution argued that if let out on bail, he could potentially influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. Also, given the fear of the 10-year jail term that could be handed to him, he could abscond. Taking into account his conduct inside the jail and during the investigation, the court agreed with the prosecution and refused to grant him bail. In the order document detailing the arguments of the prosecution, there was one specific argument that deserved further investigation. The prosecution had argued that Shahrukh Pathan’s father, Sabir Ali (alias Baldev Singh) was convicted for 10 years with a fine of Rs 1 lac under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and sections of the NDPS Act. OpIndia pulled up the court judgement in the case where Shahrukh Pathan’s father was convicted by a Delhi court. The judgement convicting him was pronounced on 11th August 2016. The facts of the case, detailed in the court order, almost read like a movie. In January 2010, Meghalaya Police filed a complaint in Delhi that three Pakistani nationals Abdul Razzaq, Mohd. Saddique and Rafakat Ali who had been brought from Lampur Seva Sadan (FRRO detention centre) on 1st January 2010 to Guru Nanak Eye Hospital for their medical examination had escaped while they were being taken back. During the investigation to track down the missing Pakistanis, the visitor’s register which was maintained by Meghalaya Police was also checked. The entries in the register made from 28/9/2009 to 02/01/2010 revealed that two people – Anees Khan and Arbaz Khan – had met Abdul Razzaq and Saleem on 29/12/2009 and 30/12/2009. During interrogation, it was revealed that before absconding on 1/1/2010, the three Pakistanis had after going to Gurunanak Eye Hospital were first taken to Jama Masjid and then one of them (Abdul Razzak) was taken by him to Seelampur near Jaffarbad to collect money from someone. Anees and Arbaz were nephews of Sabir Ali. It is pertinent to understand here that the three Pakistanis were in India illegally and therefore, were being held at a detention centre. From the story so far, it is also clear that they were given harbour at Jama Masjid from where one of them was taken to Seelampur (near Jaffrabad) to collect money – the very area where the Delhi anti-Hindu riots had broken out in February 2020 – in which Shahrukh Pathan was also leading a mob. Based on this investigation, Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh), Anees Khan and Arbaz were called to the Special Cell office and inquiries were made from them. During interrogation, it was revealed that it was Sabir Ali (Baldev Singh) who had given money to Abdul Razzaq at Seelampur before he had absconded. Essentially, from the records so far, it is clear that it was Shahrukh Pathan’s father who had give money to a Pakistani before they had absconded. This money was give to the illegal in Seelampur. The numbers that were taken from the accused during interrogation were then thoroughly investigated after those detained and questioned – including the father of Shahrukh Pathan – were set free. During the surveillance of the numbers, it was revealed that the accused – including Pathan’s father – were involved in the business of fake currency and drugs. There was also an intercepted call where Sabir Ali had spoken about the international smuggling of drugs. After this surveillance, when a notice was served to Sabir Ali, Arbaz and Anees, they refused to answer the notice served by the special cell. The Special Cell then received information about a Charas and Smack delivery that Sabir Ali and his co-accused Sannaullah Mir were about to make. When the raiding party intercepted Ali and Mir, they discovered drugs in their possession. Substantial amounts of drugs were also found on the scooter of Sabir Ali – the substance in the scooter was heroin. After the subsequent arrest, Mir and Ali were interrogated separately. During interrogation, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, Sabir Ali, confessed that he was in the business of drugs and fake currency notes along with his associates Anees, Arbaz, Jarnail and Mir. He also disclosed how the police could arrest Jarnail Singh and revealed that on an earlier occasion, Singh had given him 2 lacs and drugs, parts of which were then distributed to the others. He also agreed to lead the police to another accused – Javed. Several of the co-accused were then arrested post-interrogation of Ali. In 2011, all the accused persons were charged for the offences u/s 29 r.w.s. 21, 20 and 23 of the NDPS Act and accused Sabir Ali was separately charged for the offence u/s 21(c), 25A of the NDPS Act and accused Sanaullah Mir was separately charged for the offence of u/s 20 (b) (ii) (C) of the NDPS Act. All the accused persons were also charged for the offences u/s 489 C r.w.s. 120B IPC.In court, the prosecution examined 39 witnesses in all to prove its case against the accused. All the accused, including the father of Shahrukh Pathan, took the defence that they had been falsely implicated by the police and that no contraband/counterfeit currency notes had been recovered from their possession or at their instance at any point in time. Among all the accused, the court ‘particularly’ was intrigued by the defence of Sabir Ali alias Baldev Singh. It is pertinent to mention here that Shahrukh Pathan’s father was previously a Sikh named Baldev Singh and had converted to Islam before marrying. When Sabir Ali started explaining why he was supposedly implicated by the police, he ended up revealing his long illustrious career as a criminal. Here is what the court document said: “In particular accused Baldev Singh has stated that he originally belongs to Punjab and shifted to Delhi in 1984 due to political turmoil and terrorist activities in Punjab. In Delhi he started selling garments from a patri in Chandni Chowk but in the year 1984 the police officials of Maurice Nagar falsely arrested him on a mere suspicion that he was a terrorist. When their enquiry into his antecedents did not reveal anything incriminating against him, they planted contraband on him and falsely implicated him in a case under the Excise Act. After spending three years in the jail in the said case, he came out and started working as a driver for a transport company. During the said services a vehicle which he was driving was intercepted by DRI and contraband was recovered from the same. Though he had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the contraband concealed in the said vehicle, he was arrested by DRI and also subsequently convicted in the said case and again spent more than 10 years in judicial custody. After coming out from the jail after undergoing the sentence in the said case he again started his life afresh and started doing the business of pannis/plastics and started living with his children, his wife, his brother in law, Anees and Arbaz, the son of his second brother in law Babu Khan, in his house H.No. U­108, Gali no. 5, Arvind Nagar, Gautam Vihar, Gonda. He suspects that somebody in his locality informed the local police officials about his previous records and that is why the officials of Special Cell came to his residence in the first week of January, 2010 and forcibly picked him, his son and Anees and Arbaz and took them to PS and started inquiring about same Pakistani nationals who had absconded. Though they were released from the PS after the police officials found nothing incriminating against them, on 3/9/2010 again he, Anees and Arbaz were forcibly picked up from their residence at 1:30 a.m. in the night and brought to the office of Special cell, Rohini and falsely implicated in this case”. Essentially, Shahrukh Pathan’s father at the time had asserted that he was being falsely implicated by the police in this case of collusion with Pakistanis and being involved in an international drug peddling and fake currency racket because he had done exactly that in the past, been convicted for it, and therefore, the police thought of him as a convenient target. Further, he also dared to claim that all the previous times he was caught with contrabands and convicted, even then, he was falsely implicated. The shoddy defence that was put up by Sabir Ali was backed only by one witness – the witness’ only testimony was that he had never seen a Pakistani enter the home of Ali. This statement was made without any evidence. The court said, “The testimony of the prosecution witnesses is trustworthy and believable and nothing has emerged in their cross­examination which cast doubt on the veracity of their statement or to impeach their creditworthiness”. The court also said that all the seizure of drugs and fake currency was done per the law. While the defence tried to puncture technical holes in the process, the court threw out all of their arguments and convicted the accused – including Sabir Ali. To that effect, the court said, “as far as recovery of contraband from accused Baldev Singh and Sanaullah is concerned, in my view, the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt”. While the court rejected the argument that the accused were colluding with each other, it convicted all accused for the possession of contraband substances, however, there was amply evidence of collusion as well based on the statements of Ali. Based on this evidence, Sabir Ali, the father of Shahrukh Pathan, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1 lac fine in 2016. According to reports, Shahrukh’s mother also is said to be a notorious drug peddler.In his show ‘Prime Time’ on 26th February 2020, Ravish Kumar resorted to spreading half-truths and full lies about the horrifying spate of violence that had engulfed the national capital. In pursuance of what appeared as his agenda to tarnish Hindus and portray them as the aggressors of the riots, Kumar identified Mohammad Shahrukh alias Shahrukh Pathan, who fired at Delhi Police personnel on February 24, as one ‘Anurag Mishra’. For the 26th February show, Ravish claimed that police had not yet arrested him while he was arrested on 25th February itself, good 24 hours before his show premiered. “Police ki haalat yeh hai ki abhi tak giraftar nahin hua hai. Police saaf kehti hai ki Shahrukh hai magar aap social media mein dekhiye Anurag Mishra bataya jaa raha hai. (Situation of the Police is such that they have not yet arrested him. Police says his name is Shahrukh but if you see on social media, he is called Anurag Mishra),” he spoke in his characteristic drawl during the show. Naturally, it was quite a revelation since no one had yet referred to the shooter as “Anurag Mishra” till then.He then asked Delhi Police to speak out on his identity again. He then played an undated speech of his reporter who appeared to be asking Delhi Police personnel about Shahrukh’s arrest. Slyly, Ravish Kumar then played the videos of BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and Pravesh Verma addressing rallies ahead of Delhi elections to cast aspersions that their speeches were responsible for stoking riots a month later. Further, in August 2021, 18 months after the 25-year-old Delhi anti-Hindu riots accused Shahrukh Pathan was arrested for brandishing a gun at the police and threatening them, The Quint published a white paper on him watering down his crime and making him appear like a cherubic saint. The Quint started by describing his menacing march as ‘brazen confidence in his gait’. Then the writer of the ‘Shahrukh Pathan fan page’ romanticised his criminal act. “Unfazed by the policemen in riot gear, he shot bullets in the air while media persons captured his acts in astonishment. The fact that the gym enthusiast, who was also a local, did not wear a mask to hide his identity, made his ‘bravado’ seem peculiar and odd,” the author wrote. The Quint then went on to explain how his friends described Shahrukh as someone who was into grooming and was interested in his appearance. He was characterised as someone who was a biryani-lover, liked to put gel in his hair, blow dry it, wear crisp, ironed shirts, good shoes and well, make TikTok videos. The author interviewed Pathan’s mother, who had glowing views about her son. She said her son was innocent and ‘simple-minded’.Shahrukh’s mother also highlighted counterfactual scenarios to water down her son’s criminality. She told his fans at The Quint that she often wonders, “What if she had given him food when he asked? What if the timing was a few minutes before or after namaz?” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"15 December, 2023 ","Who is Shahrukh Pathan’s father: Convicted for 10 years over drug peddling, evidence of collusion with Pakistanis and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-is-shahrukh-pathan-father-convicted-10-years-drug-peddling-collusion-pakistani-delhi-riots/,"Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.On Wednesday (December 13th) Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi’s family was targeted and attackers attempted to burn his brother Mahesh Panchal alive by pouring thinner on him in the Dabua Colony in Haryana’s Faridabad. Within hours, victim Mahesh Panchal was transferred from three hospitals while in a critical condition. Mahesh has sustained severe burn injuries, estimated to be around 60%, and he is in critical condition. The next 72 hours, according to the doctors, will be crucial for the victim.As per the information received, the assailants who burned Mahesh first attempted to capture and burn him, but they were unsuccessful. Subsequently, they poured thinner on Mahesh and set him ablaze. Following this, the accused escaped. Mahesh dived into a drain right away, but the fire was not extinguished. He then took 3-4 dips, and the fire was quenched. After that, he walked to his house, which was around 800 metres away on his own as nobody came forward to help him. When finally Mahesh somehow reached his home, Bittu Bajrangi took him the the hospital. According to media reports, the attackers led by one Armaan first confirmed Bittu Bajrangi’s brother Mahesh Panchal’s identity. ‘Are you the brother of Bittu Bajrangi?’ they questioned Mahesh Panchal. When Mahesh said yes to this question, they poured thinner on him and set him ablaze.Arman Khan, the main accused in this case, has been arrested by police and is being interrogated. Meanwhile, the police have examined the crime scene. According to the report, the white WagonR used by the attackers had no registration number. Moreover, two bikes had followed him suspiciously to the location.Meanwhile, Bittu Bajrangi stated that Mahesh has been moved around three hospitals so far. First, it was the government hospital, then it was Santosh Hospital, and now it is Prachi Hospital. The doctors have said that the next 72 hours will be critical. Several members of Hindu organisations and local BJP MLAs visited the hospital to inquire about Mahesh’s well-being.Bittu Bajrangi said that during the Nuh riots, Armaan used to sell juice in Faridabad. He had set his own shop on fire and had tried to blame local Hindus for it. However, his lie was caught during the police investigation.Bittu Bajrangi further stated that he had been receiving death threats for a long with those behind the threats asking him to “take his slippers back (Chappal lekar jao)”. The code ‘chappal’ was used by the perpetrators to remind Bajrangi about the slippers Hindus had left outside the temple when the Islamist mob attacked them during Nuh violence earlier this year.Bittu alleged that the attackers who attempted to kill his brother were all involved in the July 31 violence unleashed by Islamists in Haryana’s Nuh district. Bittu Bajrangi stated that the family sought an arms licence, but the administration refused. Not only that, but Bittu said, citing a police officer, that the person who issued the threats had also threatened a prominent Gurgaon businessman for ‘protection money’ adding that he is a seasoned criminal.Meanwhile, an OpIndia team arrived on the scene and found several police personnel stationed at the hospital. Several members of Hindu organisations also convened at the hospital. However, no one is permitted to meet with the victim. The police have imposed multiple sections in this case, including sections 147, 149, 307, and 326A. Arman, the accused, is being questioned by local police.Bittu Bajrangi told OpIndia that he is satisfied with the actions taken by the Faridabad Police in the matter so far. He has also urged people to refrain from engaging in any form of protest or unlawful activity.Bittu Bajrangi is a Hindu activist who raises his voice for the unity of Hindus. After the violence that erupted in Nuh in the Mewat region, his name gained more traction in the news. Subsequently, he was also arrested in a case of a clash with the police. At present, Bittu Bajrangi is out of jail on bail. In this case, all Hindu organisations supported him. Initially, the rumour spread rapidly that Bittu Bajrangi was associated with the Nuh violence, but the police made it clear that action was taken against Bittu Bajrangi not related to the Nuh violence, but in a different case of a clash with the police.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"15 December, 2023 ","‘They came in a vehicle with no number plates, set fire on Bittu Bajrangi’s brother’: Arman had earlier burned his own shop to blame...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bittu-bajrangis-brother-set-on-fire-arman-had-earlier-burned-his-own-shop-to-blame-hindus-says-activist/,"The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. ""There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,"" the letter reads. In a shocking case that has come to the fore from the Kondhwa region of Maharashtra’s Pune district, government land that had been earlier allotted for the construction of a playground is now being converted into a Muslim burial ground. This is after the former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe and BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar submitted a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) suggesting that the amenity space around some of the Hindu societies in Kondhwa could be the perfect location to build a burial ground (Qabristan) for the Muslim community.BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar later backtracked from the suggestion, reportedly after realising the problems of the locals and after he was informed about the issues in the area.  The letter claimed that the Kondhwa region in Pune has a large Muslim population and that it would be favorable for the community to have a burial ground nearby. Former Hadapsar @NCPspeaks MLA Chetan Tupe @ChetanVTupe n @BJP4Maharashtra leader Yogesh Tilekar @iYogeshTilekar recommended converting a Hindu-majority residential area's of #Kondhwa playground into a Muslim burial ground. Pune Municipal Corporation @PMCPune has spent 46 lakh… pic.twitter.com/AKS6vc0FfaSeveral Hindu societies around the said amenity space (survey no. 44) have complained to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) objecting to the construction of a burial ground for the Muslim community. “The societies around the plot are Hindu societies and several thousand Hindu families reside in this location. Several Hindu temples are also located in the area and building a burial ground for the Muslim community here might cause religious harm to the residents,” the letter by Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society read. The complaint dated 23rd October has been exclusively obtained by OpIndia upon which no action has been taken by the PMC yet. Similar complaint letters have been submitted by Achalnagar Sahakari Gruharachana Society Ltd and Shree Vardhaman Nagar Co-op Housing Society Ltd to the PMC highlighting that around 12000 to 15000 Hindu families reside in the locality and that it would be wrong to allow amenity space that was supposed to be a playground for a Muslim burial ground. The complaint letters obtained by OpIndia have been signed by all the society members who are Hindus. Amenity space is a portion of a building that adds convenience for all occupants of a building and that is not used exclusively by any one occupant. In the current case, the amenity space is just a wall close to societies that have registered complaints and the space is authoritatively looked after by the PMC. The controversy has been long-standing since the year 2021 when NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil submitted a letter to the PMC suggesting that the amenity space on survey no. 44 plot should be made a Muslim burial ground given that the Kondhwa region in Pune houses a large Muslim population. However, in between these years, it was later advised by the PMC’s Amenity Space Committee that a Muslim burial ground would be constructed in the amenity space on surveys no. 18 and 19 and that a playground would be constructed on survey no. 44 space. The Muslim community members then happened to press that a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be better given the closer distance and that the supposed burial ground in Survey no 18 and 19 space would cause commuting problems for the community. Several letters to PMC pressing their demand for survey no 44 space were sent by the Nagarsevak, Adv Abdul Gafar Pathan, Parveen Haji Firoz Sheikh, and former NCP MLA Chetan Tupe Patil. The letters erroneously claimed that most of the population residing around the survey no. 44 plots were Muslims and it would be a feasible space for Muslim burial ground. A similar letter advocating for a Qabristan on survey no. 44 land was submitted by the BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar on 8th May 2023 to the PMC. The letter stated that survey no. 18 and 19 spaces were too far from the Muslim locality residing in Kondhwa and that making a burial ground on survey no. 44 space would be feasible instead. The PMC on 16th May then approved the proposal based on the letter submitted by Tilekar. However, it has come to the fore that Tilekar submitted the letter after the local Muslim community members sought his help regarding the land issue. The Muslim community representatives informed Tilekar that a maximum of the Muslim population resides around survey no. 44 amenity space and that it should be converted into a Muslim burial ground. OpIndia talked to BJP MLA Yogesh Tilekar confirming the incident. He exclusively informed OpIndia that he was misinformed about the survey no. 44 spaces and the ongoing project of playground construction on the land. “I didn’t know the land was already allotted by the PMC for a playground construction. Neither did the local Muslim representatives tell me nor the PMC. The letter I sent in May 2023 pressed for a burial ground on survey no. 44 space. However, after I learned that the maximum of population residing around the survey no. 44 space is Hindu, I sent another letter demanding the cancellation of the allotment of the land for a Muslim burial ground,” Tilekar said while talking to OpIndia. The letter of cancellation that Tilekar sent to the PMC on 23rd October 2023 clearly states that the survey no. 44 amenity space is located in a crowded area and most of the population that resides in the societies around the space is Hindu. “I first thought that the area housed a large Muslim population but I was misinformed. Most of the population residing in the locality is Hindu,” the letter reads. The entire incident was exposed after an RTI activist Dr Paritosh Zaware Patil residing in the Raviraj Colorado Co-op Housing Society (next to survey no 44 amenity space) filed an RTI demanding details of the location. It came to the fore that the PMC had already allotted the land for the construction of a playground and that the government had already spent Rs 43 lakhs for construction. Surprisingly, the land still is vacant and is under controversy over the Muslim burial ground construction. The land was allotted for the construction of the playground in the year 2017 and in 2019 grant of Rs 43 lakhs for the purpose was also obtained. The project of construction of the playground was given to some Salim Construction in the year 2019 and Rs 49 lakhs had been spent for the purpose. “The land is still vacant and no playground has been constructed here. Instead, they want to make a Muslim burial ground here. This is a crowded locality and we don’t want our children to see anything that would not be good for their age,” Dr Patil confirmed. Dr. Paristosh Patil while talking to OpIndia confirmed that survey no 18 and 19 are in the East part of the Kondhwa region and that it still stands vacant. “Some people had demanded that a vegetable market should be developed there. However, in the Amenity space committee meeting, the PMC denied the permission. That land can easily be converted into a Muslim burial ground. No problem at all. But the Muslim community members want survey no 44 amenity space only which is located in the crowded Hindu locality. They say that it is a closer option for them.” Patil added that he or the other society members have nothing to do with the community. “We are not against the Muslim community. Our problem is the burial ground. How can it be constructed in a densely crowded residential locality? All our society’s flat doors face the ground and families stay with us. What if our children ask tomorrow about the burials? Like what it is and why does this happen? Many children residing in the society are too young to see this. Even if there was a demand for Hindu cremation ground, we would have opposed it,” he added. The letter submitted by the societies around survey no 44 amenity space states that there are around 12000-15000 Hindu families residing in the locality and hardly any Muslim people stay in the societies. “There are also several temples in the area and converting the space into a Muslim burial ground might harm our religious sentiments,” the letter reads. The complaint also says that constructing a Muslim burial ground might create health hazards. “Water used for the process might seep into the society pipes causing health hazards. The societies and the survey no 44 amenity space are just a wall away from each other,” Dr Patil confirmed. Team OpIndia also talked to some of the other society residents to know about the Muslim burial ground being constructed on the nearby premises. One of the Raviraj Colorado society residents stated that several unknown persons are calling the society residents after the complaint to the PMC saying the Muslim burial ground will be built on survey no. 44 land come what may. “People are threatening us and saying that the inauguration of the burial ground will be executed in January next year. We all are scared and don’t want to see people getting buried there,” said Neelam Shah, one of the residents (name changed for security reasons). She further added that several Hindu organizations and concerned legal committees are looking into the case and people here are even ready to protest. “The roadway to the ground is really narrow as the locality is already crowded. Single lanes lead to the ground in question. School buses also pass through the same routes. Imagine now if someone dies from their community (God forbid) and they get the body to the ground for burial and then there’s also a bus passing through the same route.. our children will be forced to see what they should not at this age? Moreover, the traffic issues might also increase. The Muslim burial ground here is a bad idea,” she pressed. Neelam further added that the amenity space which is vacant at present is used by some of the miscreants to carry out immoral and illegal activities. On asking about the ‘immoral activities’, Shah said that people use the site for drinking and all wrong purposes after the evening hours. “This also should stop,” she demanded.The resident also added that some of the people living in the societies are leaving their properties and selling at a loss due to the increasing influence of the Muslim community. “The Muslim burial ground is making people leave their hard-earned homes. This is not done,” she adds. Another resident Jyotsna Patil (name changed for security reasons) also confirmed that most of the population staying here in the Kondhwa region is Hindu. “The burial ground can result in severe health hazards. Not instantly but in the coming 4-5 years people will notice changes in the environment here and their health to be specific. This is hazardous. Also, this is a Hindu community crowded space. Religiously, it would be incorrect to have another community burial ground here. Strict action should be taken in this case,” Patil said. The PMC is said to have taken action based on the letter submitted by BJP’s Yogesh Tilekar. However, Tilekar stated that he was misinformed about the location and that no he is ready to do anything to stop the ‘playground’ being converted into a Muslim burial ground. Reportedly, the Amenity Space Committee of Pune Municipal Corporation has taken no action on the cancellation request submitted by the BJP MLA. The decision shall be taken in the upcoming meeting of the body. At present, the amenity space contains a jogging track and a few rest places. The remaining portion of the land stands vacant. It is important to note that Pune’s Kondhwa region has been in the news for some time. In July this year, the National Investigation Agency arrested a doctor from the Kondhwa region for sheltering ISIS members. Also, three residents from the Mithanagar area of Kondhwa had been arrested by NIA for promoting terrorist activities at the behest of the global terrorist outfit Islamic State (IS). Later, in August, it had come to the fore that the accused ISIS operatives organized and participated in bomb-making workshops in Pune’s Kondhwa area in 2022. The central investigation agency received credible intelligence that these accused and their associates were recruiting youth and training them to make Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and weapons. They also shared Do It Yourself (DIY) kits and other relevant materials among themselves for creating IEDs and manufacturing small weapons, pistols, and more. Notably, the accused were also involved in creating content for the pro-ISIS magazine ‘Voice of Hind’. The online magazine led to several raids by the NIA in October 2021 in Kashmir. On 5th August, the accused were sent to ATS custody by a Pune court. ATS informed the court they found incriminating material from the accused, including an Indian map with several cities marked, laptops containing material to study the modus operandi of terror attacks, and more. The initial probe revealed they have links to the Al Sufa module. However, a later investigation revealed they all were part of ISIS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

It must be mentioned that Bengalis have a history of resisting the imposition of non-native languages particularly Urdu. Watch the video👇 pic.twitter.com/sXzRjE4yuBIn fact, one of the reasons leading up to the Bangladesh Liberation War was the imposition of Urdu over Bengali in then-East Pakistan. As such, the prophecy by Kolkata Mayor that half of the State of West Bengal will one day speak in Urdu was meant to spark controversy. The viral video of Firhad Hakim was recorded on 11th February 2021 during an event hosted by the West Bengal Urdu Academy.During the event dubbed ‘Mushaira 2021’, he was heard saying, “There was a time when Urdu speakers did not feel like they belonged to Bengal. There was no official status for Urdu. I want to thank Mamata Banerjee for making Urdu the second official language of Bengal.”“We have increased the budget of the Urdu Academy to ₹15 crore,” he informed. Firhad Hakim said that his ancestors came from Bihar and spoke Urdu at home. He also called upon the West Bengal Urdu Academy to take measures to propagate the language in the State of West Bengal.It must be mentioned that Mamata Banerjee engaged in appeasement politics soon after becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2011. A year later in February 2012, she made Urdu the second language in areas of the State where Urdu speakers were equal to or more than 10% of the population.The Trinamool Congress government had identified a total of 18 such Urdu-speaking areas -Goalpokhar I and II blocks, Islalmpur block, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Islampur Municipality, Garulia Municipality, Titagarh Municipality, Kamarhati Municipality, Bhatpara Municipality, Champdani Municipality, Bansberia Municipality, Bhadreswar Municipality, Rishra Municipality, Asansol Municipal Corporation, Jamuria Municipality, Raniganj Municipality, Kulti Municipality and Bally Municipality.However, this is not the first time when the Mayor of Kolkata has been in the news for the wrong reasons. In April 2016, he had dubbed a Muslim-dominated area of Kolkata as ‘Mini-Pakistan‘ In February 2021, he was spotted delivering a political speech at a masjid in Kolkata, in blatant violation of the Model Code of Conduct. To pacify Muslim rioters during the anti-CAA movement, Firhad Hakim referred to them as ‘brothers.’ The Kolkata Mayor was earlier seen referring to the Central Armed forces and the BJP as ‘Suar er baccha‘ (progency of pigs).Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

A report by the Reserve Bank of India shows that Rajasthan has a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore by the end of the financial year 2022-23. This debt was only Rs 2.81 lakh crore in 2018 when Ashok Gehlot took over the office. Ashok Gehlot has imposed a new loan of Rs 2.55 lakh crore on Rajasthan in the last five years.The state of Rajasthan welcomed its new Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma last week. Sharma took the oath of office as Rajasthan’s 16th chief minister. Additionally, he’s made some important decisions. But much remains to be done, particularly because Rajasthan’s economy suffered considerable harm due to the previous Congress administration under Ashok Gehlot.In Rajasthan, changing the government every five years has become a trend for the past thirty years. Nevertheless, the state’s economy has suffered each time the Congress government has taken office. The statistics indicate the same thing this time around.Although Rajasthan has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the nation and a massive debt load, its GDP has not increased significantly over the previous five years. Apart from this, the Gehlot government’s profligacy has left the state in the throes of a severe economic crisis.Rajasthan is presently drowning in debt. A report by the Reserve Bank of India shows that Rajasthan has a debt of Rs 5.37 lakh crore by the end of the financial year 2022-23. This debt was only Rs 2.81 lakh crore in 2018 when Ashok Gehlot took over the office. Ashok Gehlot has imposed a new loan of Rs 2.55 lakh crore on Rajasthan in the last five years.The Congress government looted the government treasury continuously to bring in new appeasement schemes and get votes. It is noteworthy that Ashok Gehlot referred to the Rs 1.63 lakh crore loan taken by the previous Vasundhara Raje government as extremely high when he took office in 2018. He is now the one who has buried the state in debt.Rajasthan’s financial situation is appalling. This state’s debt amounts to 40% of its GDP. It shouldn’t go over 20% in any state, according to the FRBM Act, which establishes borrowing caps for the federal government and the states. However, it has doubled as a result of the Congress government’s extravagant spending.It’s not like accepting this loan would have allowed Ashok Gehlot to propel the state’s development in a new direction. Conversely, the economy of Rajasthan has expanded at a fairly normal rate during his tenure. When the state’s Congress government left office in 2013, Rajasthan’s GDP was Rs 4.93 lakh crore.Under the BJP government, it rose to Rs 6.28 lakh crore by 2018. Following this, the state’s GDP was Rs 7.99 lakh crore in 2023 compared to 2018. Over these two periods, the state’s GDP grew by 27.2%. Yet, the Congress government borrowed far more money to achieve the same growth.The Congress government has indulged in careless expenses to carry on its appeasement policies over the last 5 years. The difference between the state’s revenue and expenses, or the fiscal deficit, has grown dramatically over the previous five years. It was Rs 25,342 crore in 2018, the year the BJP government was forced to resign, and it has more than doubled to Rs 58,212 crore when Ashok Gehlot leaves office in 2023. This represents 4.3% of the GDP of Rajasthan. The rule says it should not exceed 3%.Ashok Gehlot has left office after taking the state’s economy on a nosedive. Under these circumstances, Bhajanlal Sharma, the new chief minister, will need to exercise extreme caution. He will need to pay back debts while simultaneously bringing the economy back to life. Apart from this, strengthening law and order will be critical to the growth of the economy.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Police has also been deployed and only doctors are allowed to speak to Mahesh. The attackers, who poured thinner on and set fire to Mahesh, were led by an Armaan.On 13th December night (Wednesday), an attempt was made on the life of Mahesh, the younger brother of Hindu activist Bittu Bajrangi, in Dabua Colony, Faridabad.The accused tried to burn Mahesh Panchal alive. He remains in a critical condition and has been transferred to a third hospital for treatment.35-year-old Mahesh, who has suffered 60% burns, is the father of a daughter. The daughter is the only successor of Bittu’s family.Bittu Bajrangi family’s survives with hand-to-mouth earnings by selling vegetables. OpIndia team met Bittu Bajrangi’s family on Thursday (14 December 2023).Bittu Bajrangi’s entire family was present in Prachi Hospital in Faridabad where we met them. Bittu’s father and mother have died a long time ago. Bittu is not married.The reason for this, he says, is to dedicate himself to the service of Hindu dharma. Bittu’s brother Mahesh, who was set on fire by pouring thinner, is admitted in the burn ward of the hospital.Policemen were seen deployed at the gate. Apart from administrative officials, no one is allowed to meet Mahesh except doctors.We saw a girl of about 5 years playing at the gate of the hospital. When we asked her name, the girl introduced herself as Deepika.Deepika said her father’s name is Mahesh. Deepika is too young to realise the seriousness of what has happened to her father.She says she is student of class KG. She identifies her father as Kariya too, which is Mahesh’s nickname at home. She also recited ABCD to us.Her mother, Mahesh’s wife, could not hold back her tears while we tried speaking to her.When we asked Deepika what she wants to become when she grows up, she said, ‘a doctor’. When we asked her the reason for becoming a doctor, she said she wants to cure sick people.Deepika may be too young to ascertain the seriousness of the situation, but she knows that something has happened to her father. This was clear to us when she said that the first person she will give injection to when she becomes a doctor is her father.Deepika’s mother told us that her daughter is a bright student but due to incidents like Bittu’s arrest and now the attack on her husband, her daughter’s studies are getting affected a lot.The family has spent all their money on Mahesh’s treatment and is now facing a financial crisis.OpIndia spoke to Bittu about his family background. Bittu said that his late father had built a small house in Faridabad by doing small jobs.Their family lives in the same house. After the death of their father, Bittu and his brother Mahesh started supporting the family by selling vegetables.Due to Bittu’s involvement with Hindu organizations, the responsibility of running the family fell on his brother Mahesh. Mahesh was married in a village near Palwal. Five years ago he became the father of a girl. This girl is now the only light in Bittu Bajrangi’s house.On the day of the incident, Mahesh was selling vegetable at his shop. A group of men threw thinner on him and set him on fire. Mahesh’s in-laws were also present at the hospital.Speaking to OpIndia on the evening of 16th December, Bittu Bajrangi said that his brother’s condition has improved by about 10%. He also told that due to the calamity at home, his niece’s education has stopped.In one of his Facebook posts, Bittu Bajrangi has also accused local leaders of ignoring him. Apart from Arman Khan, no other name has come to light among the accused till now. SIT is investigating the case.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On 18th December (Monday), the Times of India commemorated the birth anniversary of Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin describing him as ‘The Man of Steel’. Shared as a Trivia factoid, the post eulogised him with a poster listing key facets of his “leadership”.

CPI(M)’s Puducherry unit praising the Communist dictator wrote, “Comrade Joseph Stalin, born on December 18, 1878, a revolutionary Bolshevik who led the victorious Antifascist war and laid the foundation for a strong working-class state of the planet.

Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labour camps, forced collectivisation, famine and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women.In a century, communist states have killed approximately 100 million people, according to Ilya Somin’s articles. Joseph Stalin’s attempts to collectivise agriculture and production in Russia resulted in the deaths of 6 to 10 million people. Stalin imposed collective agriculture, prohibiting people from cultivating on their own, and imprisoning dissenters in Siberian labour camps. In Russia and Ukraine, millions went hungry, and hundreds of thousands died in prison camps. When Ukrainian production fell short of Stalin’s quota, he punished them even more by taking away everything they had. In Ukraine, Stalin’s forced famine is termed ‘Holodomor’ by joining the words for hunger (holod) and mor (extermination or mass-murder).Stalin’s atrocities were not restricted to the Soviet famine; he also carried out the ‘Great Purge,’ in which everyone he disapproved of was imprisoned, tortured, or executed. No one was spared, even wealthy peasants, politicians, military men, and ethnic minorities. The Purge alone is thought to have killed over 1.2 million people.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"18 December, 2023 ","Times of India eulogises Joseph Stalin, the communist dictator who killed millions, as ‘The Man of Steel’ ",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/times-of-india-eulogises-joseph-stalin-communist-dictator-steel-man/,"As per the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia, all four accused have been booked under sections 354B (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint), 295A and 298 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 11 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.Last month, OpIndia reported an exclusive case from the Pune district of Maharashtra where two minor girls were forcefully sent to an orphanage in Daund and were forcefully converted to Christianity. The girls were also forced to clean toilets, were influenced against Hinduism and Hindu Gods and Goddesses, and were beaten, and tortured after their mother’s death in the year 2020. The Police have taken cognizance of the event and have filed an FIR against the Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission and its three Matrons identified as Sakshi Bhalerao, Nisha More, and Vaishali Bhasker for assaulting and torturing the minor girls and converting them to Christianity. As per the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia, all four accused have been booked under sections 354B (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint), 295A (Whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class) and 298 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 11 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. FIR has been filed based on the complaint registered by one of the maternal aunts of the victims. It has come to the fore that the two minor girls aged 9 and 11 respectively were confined to the Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission orphanage which is located in the Daund region of the Pune district. The girls were forced to clean public toilets and were not provided with good food and clothes in the orphanage. They also were forced to take baths in public by the authorities at the orphanage. The girls were converted to Christianity and baptized by the authorities at the orphanage. They were also forced to go to church on Sundays and were barred from wearing Bindi, bangles, and any Hindu religious symbol in jewellery form on their body. They were brain-fed that “Hindu Gods are dead. They don’t exist. People only apply haldi kumkum on idols unnecessarily.” The girls were also made to believe that Jesus is the only existing God. The aunt of the girl mentioned in the complaint that she was rarely allowed to meet the girls for 1 and a half years and was not allowed to take them at home for vacations. The aunt of the girls also said that the orphanage refused to hand over the girls to the family saying that they were receiving foreign funds from every girl confined in the orphanage and that they could not afford to lose the girls for money. “However, they kept on trying to convince us that the girls were being taken care of and that they would be sent to foreign countries for education. But we were being cheated,” the complainant said. The two victim minor girls are from the Shivajinagar area of Pune. They had been staying with their maternal aunt in the Bhavani Peth area after their mother died. The girls’ father shared minimal bond with them given that they were girls. “My sister and her husband shared no relation after these two girls were born. She had been staying with our mother in Pune. And after she died in 2021, I took responsibility for her daughters (two victims of this case),” said the maternal aunt of the two minor girls. As per the information obtained by OpIndia, the girls had been studying at the Bapusaheb Pawar Prathmik School in Bhavani Peth. Some of the NGOs like the Bharatiya Samajseva Kendra were associated with the school ensuring the welfare of the students. In the year 2021, one of the social workers from the NGO called the aunt of the girls and said that the father of the girls wouldn’t take proper care of the girls. She suggested the woman admit the girls into a good hostel for better education and lifestyle. Despite several refusals from the aunt, the social worker convinced the family and contacted the Bal Kalyan Samiti in Yerwada through which she got the girls admitted to Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission in Daund. The aunt of the girls was assured that they would be allowed to meet the girls and talk to them over the phone whenever they wanted. The aunt and the other family members of the girls were also assured that all the financial needs of the girls would be taken care of and that they would be sent to foreign for further education. The authorities at the orphanage also reportedly told the family that the marriage expenses of the women would also be taken care of. Earlier, the aunt of the girls was told that they would be kept at the hostel. However, they were deceptively kept at the orphanage and were confined for almost two years. The girls were not allowed to meet their aunts and were not allowed to communicate with them openly. The two minor girls in their confession to the police said that they were tortured at the orphanage and were not provided with proper clothes, food, and other basic needs. The girls also said that they were made to clean public toilets and wash vessels at the orphanage. As per the FIR- The aunt of the girls maintained in the complaint that the girls would not be allowed to talk properly to them. They would be kept watch on continuously when we would visit them. “After the admission of the girls to the hostel (orphanage), me and my two other sisters went to meet the girls. The first time we were treated very nicely. But as I demanded to take the girls home for a few days or vacations they would not allow. Slowly slowly they began keeping us away from the girls. Someone from the orphanage authorities would always be present with the girls ensuring that they don’t reveal the atrocities faced by them,” the aunt said. On 3rd May 2023, after the mistreatment came to the fore, the father of the girls submitted a letter to the orphanage saying that he wanted his kids back and that he was capable enough to take care of them. Nisha More from the orphanage then rejected the proposal and said that the girls now belonged to the orphanage and that ‘the father now had no relation with the girls.’ Accused Nisha More also replied to the father saying that the orphanage received specific amounts from the foreign countries behind every child in the orphanage and that they would not lose the girls. She further convinced the father saying that the orphanage would take all the financial responsibility of his kids and need not worry about them now. The girl’s aunt learned about the orphanage’s response and found it scary. She sought help from the Bal Kalyan Samiti to get custody of the kids. However, the authorities at the Samiti, Wasim Sheikh, and other women officials abused her and hurled caste-related abuse. “You low-caste, illiterate people will never change,” the authorities said. The Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission in Kedgaon, Daund, was established in the year 1889. As per its official website, the missionary is ‘committed to the empowerment of destitute women and children since 1889’. It is a Christ-centered home where destitute women and children irrespective of their background are ‘cared for’, transformed, and empowered as per the vision statement mentioned on its website. “We seek, in the Spirit of Christ, to sow seeds of change in the lives of every individual under the care of Mukti Mission, skillfully counselling them to Deal with the issues of life, Initiating varied opportunities of healing and shaping them prayerfully as models of God’s kingdom for the society at large,” the NGO’s mission statement reads. The basis and operation of the Mission are based on Isaiah 61: 1 & 4 of the Bible which reads, “The spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.” In the given case, the two minor girls have been forcefully converted by the Missionary. As reported earlier, the entire incident got exposed when one of the aunts got associated with a Pune-based NGO named the Indian Human Rights Council (IHRC) and local Hindu organizations. The complaint was then sent to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) which issued a notice seeking severe action in the case. The Commission also noted that the details of the two minors had not been uploaded on the Commission’s Bal Swaraj Portal- Covid Care given the reason for the death of the minor’s mother was suspicion of COVID-19. The girls were finally released by the Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission on 11th November 2023 and were safely handed over to the aunts by the local Hindu organizations. Team OpIndia tried to contact the orphanage for a comment but to no avail. A complaint has been filed against the Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission and its three Matrons identified as Sakshi Bhalerao, Nisha More, and Vaishali Bhasker for assaulting and torturing the minor girls and converting them to Christianity. All four accused have been booked under sections 354B (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint), 295A (Whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class) and 298 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 11 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 based on the complaint registered by one of the maternal aunts of the victims.

"18 December, 2023 ","Ghaziabad: Brothers Sufiyan and Mahtab strangle sister Sheeba to death for love affair with Hindu boy, body dumped in canal",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ghaziabad-brothers-sufiyan-and-mahtab-strangle-sister-to-death-for-love-affair-with-hindu-boy-body-dumped-in-canal/,"There was a rumour on social media that some unknown assailants poisoned Dawood Ibrahim, and he was admitted to hospital in critical condition.On 18th December, while Indian social media was abuzz with the unconfirmed reports of notorious terrorist Dawood Ibrahim being poisoned and in critical condition, Republic TV confirmed that those were just rumours. In a report, Republic TV noted that a relative of Dawood Ibrahim dismissed the claims made in social media reports that Dawood was admitted to a hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, due to health complications.There were reports that unknown persons poisoned the most wanted Indian terrorist. Speaking to Republic TV, the relative claimed that Dawood was not poisoned. The relative said, “News of poisoning is not correct. Also, we are unaware of his whereabouts”.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters/terrorists that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer from Mumbai, it is believed that Dawood Ibrahim now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States, with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives. While Dawood’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Dawood Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refuses to accept his presence in the country.On 17th December 2023, there was a rumour on social media that some unknown assailants poisoned Dawood Ibrahim, and he was admitted to hospital in critical condition. The rumour surfaced after the internet went kaput in Pakistan to curb the circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally. Fake screenshots of Pakistan PM’s posts, and fanning of the rumours by journalists fed fuel to the rumours. In 2020, there were reports that Dawood Ibrahim and his wife contracted Coronavirus. It was one of the “silver lining” reports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, it was reported that he died of the infection. However, the reports were proven wrong, and Dawood lived. However, his nephew Siraj Kaskar, the son of Dawood’s elder brother Sabir Kaskar, did die of COVID-19 in Pakistan. In 2017, there were reports that Dawood died of a heart attack. Some reports suggested he had a brain tumour that led to his worsening health. However, the reports later proved to be fake. Chota Shakeel, Dawood’s right hand man, said in a statement, “Listening to my voice, do you think any such thing has happened? These are all rumours, Bhai is fit and fine.”In 2016, there was another rumour on social media that Dawood got gangrene on his legs, and doctors might have had to amputate them. In April 2016, CNN News18 reported that Dawood Ibrahim was suffering from an advanced stage of gangrene, and soon, doctors would not have any option but to cut off his legs. The report further claimed that if his situation worsened and he died, it would be a big blow to India’s efforts to bring him to justice. NDTV put the terrorist on death bed and reported there was a hunt for his successor. Times of India busted the rumour quoting Chota Shakeel who said, “Your agencies have the wrong information. Dawood is perfectly fit.”While Dawood Ibrahim is still alive, several wanted terrorists and their associates have been killed by unknown assailants in Pakistan. OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On Friday (15th December) night, about 10 idols of deities kept in three Hindu temples were vandalised in Alfadanga upazila in Faridpur district in Dhaka Division of Bangladesh.As per a report in Prothom Alo, the three desecrated temples were identified as Kendriya Hari Mandir, Sri Sri Vishnu Pagal Mandir and Sri Sri Damodar Akhara. The places of worship are located within 1 km of the Alfadanga municipality.According to the Bengali daily, four idols of Goddess Manasa, Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati and one idol of Lord Shiva were vandalised at the Kendriya Hari Mandir. Similarly, two idols of Lord Shiva and Goddess Manasa were destroyed at the Sri Sri Vishnu Pagal Mandir.The unidentified miscreants also vandalised a Shivling and idols of Lord Shiva and Lord Narayana, which were kept at the Sri Sri Damodar Akhara. In total, they attacked 10 idols belonging to Hindu gods and Goddesses.After the matter came to light, the locals informed the police. While speaking about the incident, Officer-in-Charge of the (Alfadanga) police station Salim Reza said that the cops reached the crime spot immediately after receiving information.He said that a case would be filed and that the CCTV footage of the temple premises was collected. On Sunday (17th December), members of the Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (HBCUC) staged a demonstration at Alfadanga Chowrastra, demanding rapid action against those involved in idol vandalism. A human chain was formed by the protestors seeking justice against religious persecution. A day earlier, another protest march was organised jointly by the Upazila Puja Udayapan Committee and HBCUC.Earlier on 6th November, a case of temple desecration and idol vandalism came to light in the Bijulia village of Shailkupa upazila of Bangladesh. After learning about the incident, the local Hindus alerted the police. A similar case of idol vandalism took place in the area in October 2022. Islamists orchestrated it under the supervision of a Chhatra League (student wing of Bangladesh Awami League) leader. “Last year, they broke the idol of Goddess Kali and discarded the head of the deity. There is an upcoming election in the country. I hope such incidents are not repeated this time…I hope we can live in peace,” a local Hindu woman said.In February this year, OpIndia reported about a series of planned attacks on at least 14 Hindu temples across the Islamic country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.""on 17th and 18th December, a video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni went viral on social media. As per the subtitles in the video, she was seen saying that Islam is not compatible with European values and culture. Islam is being perpetrated (in Italy) through Saudi Arabia’s funding and Saudi Arabia has Sharia law. Meloni further says that the Sharia law is not compatible with Europian values and culture. The whole of Europe is being Islamised.There is no similarity between our culture and Islam.Islam is being spread by Saudi in Italy.There is Sharia law in Saudi, which we will not allow to be implemented in Italy.: Georgia Meloni, PM, Italy pic.twitter.com/uCqYhpodBuThe same alleged statement was reported by a number of media houses, mostly Indian.

A number of Indian media houses including WION, Hindustan Times, Mint, NDTV, and Times Now reported the same claims. NDTV used a X post embed of a handle named Geopolitical Kid and wrote that Meloni’s statement was given during the political event organised by her party. However, Meloni’s statement regarding Islam’s alleged incompatibility wasn’t found in any international publications in the last 24-hour window. Radio Genoa, a popular handle on X, seemed to have first posted the video. Italian PM Giorgia Meloni: “I believe that there is a problem of compatibility between Islamic culture and the values ​​and rights of our civilization. The Islamic cultural centers in Italy are financed by Saudi Arabia where Sharia is in force. In Europe there is a very… pic.twitter.com/wEn8Fl4JC2However, Radio Genoa has not cited a time frame, and has not written that Meloni’s statement was recent. Upon searching with the keywords and comparing it with Meloni’s video clip going viral, we found that the original video was posted on YouTube back in 2018. The video was posted by the YouTube channel alanews in 2018. The original video can be seen here. In the video, Meloni is seen saying, “Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.”In that video, Meloni was referring to a previous statement by another conservative leader Matteo Salvini. Salvini, referring to the Cologne mass sexual attacks and Berlin terrorist attack, had said that Islam is incompatible with European values. Salvni is a leader of Italy’s Lega Nord party. Conclusion: While the viral video of Giorgia Meloni is mostly correct in rough translation, the video, or the statement, are not recent. They are from 5 years ago, and not from the recent political event organised by Meloni’s party. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Of these, 10 schools received affiliation a few months ago before violence broke out and 15 schools during the violence period.The official team inquired with the ZEOs about the matter over the phone. The ZEOs responded saying that they had not issued any NOC for any school and added that the NOC must be fake and signatures forged.Sources reportedly said that further probe is underway to find the persons responsible for the forging of signatures on the fake NOCs.Moreover, ZEOs are not authorised to issue NOCs as approval of the minister and concerned commissioner is mandatory. The government is also probing the ZEOs to establish whether they are lying or not.Meanwhile, Haokip in his X post after the press release stated that this is a “diversionary tactic orchestrated by the N Biren Singh government”.He said that he along with two more people namely Th. Brindan and JNIMS are being made easy targets in order to avoid backlash for the 60 Kuki-Zo and 4 Meitei victims of violence in the state.“Regarding the social media post about CBSE School Affiliations, it is available on the official website of CBSE for verification.

"18 December, 2023 ","Fake schools propping up in Churachandpur, Kangpokpi? Manipur govt fact checks Congress worker, says no NOC issued since May 2023",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fake-schools-propping-up-in-churachandpur-kangpokpi-manipurgovt-fact-checks-congress-worker-says-no-noc-issued-since-may-2023/,"Dawood Ibrahim was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. On Monday (18th December), social media was abuzz with rumours of the death of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, who has been hiding in Pakistan for decades. As per the rumours, Ibrahim was poisoned by an unknown person, and he was rushed to hospital. Some posts on social media claimed he was critical, while others claimed that he died. The rumours began spreading on Sunday (17th December) after Pakistan’s internet went down.Amid the rumours, an alleged screenshot of caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar Ul Haq Kakar, went viral on social media with claims that the said post confirmed the death of Ibrahim. The post read, “The Messiah of humanity, dear to every Pakistani heart, our beloved His Excellency Dawood Ibrahim passed away due to poisoned by unknown. He breathed his last in a hospital in Karachi. May Allah grant him the highest position in Jannat. Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.”However, when OpIndia investigated the screenshot and the official handle of the Pakistani PM, we found that there was no such tweet. Furthermore, the handle used in the screenshot was anwaar_kakkar, while the real ID of the Pakistani PM is anwaar_kakar. There is a handle called anwaar_kakkar, but that is a fan account of PM Kakar, and there was no such tweet either. It was evident that someone artificially created the post by adding text and a Grey Verified Check Mark on the fan account.Pakistani journalists also fuelled the rumours. In a recent episode of Bheja Fry, Pakistani journalist Aarzoo Kazmi talked about the rumours surrounding the poisoning of Dawood Ibrahim and his critical health in the hospital. She highlighted the fact that there was an internet shutdown in the country and emphasised that something was happening in Pakistan. She also talked about the rumours of Dawood Ibrahim’s poisoning and critical health. While she fanned the rumours, the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed.As per Aaj Tak, Ibrahim was indeed admitted to the hospital two days back. It is unclear what was the reason, but several reports talked about the rumours of him being poisoned.Though the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed, it was indeed a fact that internet services faced a massive crackdown in Pakistan on 17th December. Social media services and search engines stopped working without any prior notice. No one could access social media platforms like X, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and the Google search engine was down. While it was rumoured that the crackdown was because of the poisoning of Ibrahim, in reality, it appeared that the Pakistani government shut down the internet to limit the access and circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer in Mumbai. It is believed that he now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.While Ibrahim’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refused to accept his presence in the country.OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ","US: Car crashes into parked motorcade of Joe Biden, President unharmed",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/us-president-joe-biden-motorcade-accident-car-crash/,"The black banners and posters have been placed inside the campus, just outside the University Guest House where the Governor is staying, Kerala Raj Bhavan released the statement.Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has taken serious note of the action of the State Police, on the direction of the Chief Minister, in placing posters defamatory to the Governor in the campus of Calicut University.The black banners and posters have been placed inside the campus, just outside the University Guest House where the Governor is staying, Kerala Raj Bhavan released the statement.Governor feels that this cannot happen without the direction of the chief minister and that this clearly is the beginning of the collapse of the constitutional machinery in the state. He said that such deliberate actions of the Chief Minister precipitate the breakdown of constitutional machinery.Coming down heavily on Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday accused him of attempting to disrupt the peaceful ambience in the state. Speaking to reporters, Vijayan said, “Arif Mohammad Khan is making a move to destroy the peaceful ambience of Kerala.”After facing a black-flag protest from members of the SFI, the students’ wing of the ruling CPI(M), the Governor claimed an attempt on his life.However, the chief minister said the governor’s actions were such that they sparked protests.CM Vijayan further highlighted the comments made by former Supreme Court justice Rohinton Nariman in a public event in Mumbai, outlining the “wholesale reference to the President,” of Bills by the Kerala governor.Vijayan further accused the governor of allegedly accepting proposals from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which, according to him, resulted in the student protests. The chief minister opposed his actions, calling them “totally wrong.”Also drawing attention to the Governor’s choice of words, Vijayan questioned how he could use such harsh language. He also expressed concern over the Governor’s approach towards individuals, who showed him black flags. He termed the action as ‘provocative’.Earlier, SFI (Students Federation of India), the student wing of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), staged a black-flag protest march to Calicut University, ahead of the Governor’s arrival on campus.Black banners and posters were put up outside Calicut University Guest House where the Governor was staying. The protesters were, however, removed from the spot by the police on the instruction of the Governor’s office.A statement from Raj Bhavan mentioned that the Governor took serious note of the action of the state police, on the direction of the Chief Minister, in placing posters defamatory to him on the campus of Calicut University.The Governor earlier claimed that the police were prevented from acting against ‘criminals’. He also accused CM Vijayan of hatching a conspiracy to harm him.“This is not a question of my comment, as I said in the morning. It is about law. We are a democratic republic and the law must prevail. The police stood like silent bystanders while the protesters were at it. It was because of political reasons that they stood by idly. My car was surrounded and the protesters banged on it with all the force that they could muster,” the Governor said.He added that he was not scared of anyone. “Due to political reasons, the Kerala Police were prevented from acting against these rowdies and criminals. I believe in facing up to brutes. I am not scared of anyone,” he added. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"17 December, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did Pakistani caretaker PM confirm that unknown men poisoned Dawood Ibrahim? Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-check-pakistani-caretaker-pm-dawood-ibrahim-death-confirmation/,"Previously, the PDP leader had described the apex court’s verdict on pleas challenging the abrogation of Article 370 as a ""death sentence"" not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the idea of India. On 17th December (Sunday), Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said that the Supreme Court’s 11th December ruling on Article 370 is not a “God’s verdict”. Speaking with reporters in Kupwara, she asserted that her party, PDP will continue to struggle for the restoration of special status to Jammu and Kashmir.Mufti said, “We don’t have to lose heart. We will continue our struggle. The Supreme Court is not God. The same Supreme Court had earlier said that Article 370 cannot be amended without the recommendation of a constituent assembly. They were also learned judges. Today some other judges passed the ruling. We cannot treat it as God’s verdict.”#WATCH | On Supreme Court verdict on Article 370 in J&K, PDP Chief Mehbooba Mufti says, ""…Supreme Court's verdict is not God's verdict, we will not lose hope and will continue our fight."" pic.twitter.com/iDpFN7TWDWShe claimed that those who oppose special status to Jammu and Kashmir, want “us to give up” on our fight. The PDP President stressed that they will not lose hope and continue the fight in this regard. She added, “Our opponents want us to give up the fight but we will continue till our last breath. We have made a lot of sacrifices and we cannot let them go in vain.” Previously, the PDP leader had described the apex court’s verdict on pleas challenging the abrogation of Article 370 as a “death sentence” not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the idea of India. Stating that the struggle in the region has been a political fight spanning several decades, Mufti had urged people not to lose hope.  Likewise, Omar Abdullah, the vice-president of the National Conference, conveyed his disappointment over Article 370 article. Dil na umeed tou nahi ⁰Na kaam hi tou hai ⁰Lambi hai gham ki shaam⁰Magar shaam hi tou haiIt is important to note that both the valley leaders who have been actively seen indulging in political activities had earlier claimed that they were house-arrested by the LG administration in the wake of the Article 370 verdict. They had also alleged that were they not allowed to talk with reporters. However, the claim was immediately rejected by Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha and Srinagar Police calling their allegations “totally baseless”.On 11th December, the Supreme Court of India upheld the Centre’s decision to abrogate Article 370 which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The five-judge constitutional bench noted that J&K did not retain any sovereignty after the instrument of accession was signed and there is no internal sovereignty for Jammu and Kashmir. It also ruled that Article 370 was a temporary provision. The court also asked the Election Commission to conduct the election to the Union Territory’s Assembly by September 30 next year.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-led government at the Centre under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked Article 370, taking away the special status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir on 5th August 2019. The state was then reorganised into two Union Territories, Ladakh and Jammu, and Kashmir.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ","“Supreme Court Not God”: Mehbooba Mufti says SC’s decision on Article 370 not God’s verdict, vows to continue to struggle for its restoration ",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mehbooba-mufti-says-scs-decision-on-article-370-not-gods-verdict/,"Parigi Congress MLA Dr. T RamMohan Reddy stated he was able to swiftly acquire the funds marking his first major achievement since taking office just over a week agoJust a week after coming to power in Telangana, the Congress government in the state has approved the allocation of Rs 2,45,93,847 crore to host an Islamic congregation in Nematnagar village of Pargi Mandal in Vikarabad district from 6th to 8th January 2024. The Tabliqhi Jamat-organised Subaee Deeni Ijtema is expected to draw between three and five lakh Muslims from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh.After careful consideration and conversation with Chief Minister Revanh Reddy, Parigi Congress MLA Dr. T RamMohan Reddy stated he was able to swiftly acquire the funds marking his first major achievement since taking office just over a week ago. Syed Umar Jaleel, Secretary of Minority Welfare, released an order stating that the money from multiple departments had been approved for the program. The Vikarabad district collector suggested setting aside the sum to provide several amenities at the venue. He is going to receive the money allotted by the Waqf Board. The CEO of the Waqf Board has been selected by the government as the nodal officer responsible for guaranteeing the timely completion of the proposed works.The different divisions receive their share of the assigned monies. A contribution of Rs 85 lakh has been made to Mission Bhagiratha which is focused on SUMP development and water delivery. The building of pipelines from ponds to the congregation location has been assigned a sum of Rs 68 lakh. The Panchayat Raj Engineering Department would supervise the development of the roads and parking areas with a budget of Rs 40 lakh. For Rs 48,35,847, transformers are going to be installed to provide a continuous power supply and transmission. The cost of the maintenance work would be Rs 4.58 lakh.Earlier, when the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) was in power, on 23rd August, the district collector for Vikarabad calculated that about 7 crores would be needed for the occasion and he forwarded the proposal to the government for approval. Subaee Deeni Ijtema preparations are already underway. Salman Khan, a member of Hyderabad Youth Courage NGO who was detained in a case involving bogus crowd fundraising and is subject to the Preventive Detention Act urged other Muslims to show up in strength for this rally. The media was told by the locals that three to five lakh Muslims are anticipated to travel to Parigi, which is located 85 kilometres from Hyderabad. This three-day Islamic assembly is scheduled to include members of Delhi Hazrat Nizamuddin.Noatbly, in 2019 Syed Umar Jaleel, an IAS officer and former Vikarabad district collector was suspended for seven months. His willful breach of an Election Commission order by opening sealed 122 EVMs and VVPATs in the strong rooms resulted in this disciplinary penalty. It is important to remember that he took these measures despite a petition on the Vikarabad assembly elections still sitting in the high court and awaiting a decision.He was appointed as the Commissioner of Intermediate Education and the Secretary of the Intermediate Board following a seven-month suspension. He subsequently announced his retirement in September 2022. Surprisingly, the BRS government once again elevated him to a prominent position in July 2022. This time for a two-year tenure, he assumed the duties of Secretary and Commissioner of the Telangana Minority Welfare Department.A similar gathering was conducted by Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi in March 2020 during which the deadly Covid virus was prevalent and most of the attendees were infected. Moreover, they scattered around the nation, causing the virus to spread widely. It was found after a police inquiry that a large number of foreigners attended this event as well and travelled to different regions of the nation which presented a security danger.The Tablighi Jamaat congregation and its activities are prohibited in many Islamic countries. Saudi Arabia outlawed Tablighi Jamaat in December 2021, referring to it as “one of the gates of terrorism.” The Tablighi Jamaat was outlawed and classified as an extremist organisation in Kazakhstan in 2013. Additionally, Iran, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan forbade the Islamic movement. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He added that the corporation had taken action previously, and the police had communicated with the vendors. East DCP Lucknow mentioned that today (17th December), the convoy of UP CM Yogi Adityanath also passed through this route. He added that today the dry fruit vendors showed indecency with the anti-encroachment team. Subsequently, when the police came to learn about the incident, they used the necessary force and brought the youths to the police station. They have been informed that this is a VIP route adding that they should cooperate with the anti-encroachment drives in the future as well.It is also notable that while the X users claimed police threw away the dry fruits being sold by the street vendors, others have said that the vendors themselves dropped the products on the streets after police asked them to vacate the place. Therefore, the police removed the street vendors not because of their identities as Kashmiris, but only because they were vending at an unauthorised place.

Kumawat has erected over 200 statues in more than 80 countries.Speaking to Hindustan Times, the temple priest Phool Kumar Sharma said, “There is security at our temple, and we will be keeping watch at night as well.”Sharma stated that there have been complaints to the authorities as well as social media outrage by some people who are discontented with the statue’s installation. The priest, however, clarified that the statue is sponsored by donations, is being made on the temple grounds and does not violate any municipal regulations.Notably, a section of Canadian netizens have unleashed a bigoted attack on the Hindu community over the statue of Lord Hanuman with many posting derogatory comments about Hindu Canadians and the Hindu gods as well.One Cosmin Dzsurdzsa wrote, “Hinduism is heavily invested in the meaning and power of symbols. Although Western thought has largely discounted religious symbolism as irrational and superstitious, ignoring an obvious projection of power in the form of a massive deific monument will be to our detriment. Why would somebody feel the need to erect a 50-foot idol outside for non-believers to see and not in a temple? The psychological motivation is curious and a legitimate question.”Why would somebody feel the need to erect a 50 foot idol outside for non-believers to see and not in a temple?

The recent online attacks only expose the deep-seated hatred for the Hindu faith and Hindus in general.If we look at the data, according to a 2021 census, Canada has a Christian population of over 19.3 million making up over half of the Canadian population. It is interesting to note that India, a Hindu majority country is home to more Christians than a Christian majority Canada with a population of over 28 million, according to 2011 census data, making them the third largest religious community in the country. Despite being a Hindu majority nation, India has always been tolerant towards religious institutions, places of worship, statues etc.When Hindu temples are attacked by Khalistani terrorists, the same intolerant Canadians go into hibernation, yet go berserk over a 55-foot statue of a Hindu god, claiming that Hindu religious symbolism is being forced in a Christian-majority Canada. In recent months, Khalistani terrorists have attacked Hindu temples in several parts of Canada, vandalising the temples and defacing the walls with anti-India and anti-Hindu graffiti, with Canadian authorities taking no concrete action. The question arises as to how one immigrant community, whose places of worship are constantly subjected to hatred and attacks by extremist sections of another and yet remains law-abiding, will obliterate or destroy “Canadian culture,” which it does not seek to do.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He stated that raids were conducted at DMCH after the video emerged, leading to the recovery of three bottles of foreign-made liquor. On 17th December (Sunday), photos and visuals of doctors allegedly consuming alcohol at a party in the dry state of Bihar started doing rounds on social media platforms. The incident of doctors partying with alcohol reportedly took place inside the guest house of Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). However, it was interrupted when someone barged in with a camera.As per reports, the party took place during the ongoing conference of paediatricians, Pedicon 2023, which is being organised at DMCH between 14-17 December.Notably, the visuals of the alcohol party were captured on camera. The footage revealed sealed imported liquor bottles abandoned on the floor after those consuming it quickly dispersed upon noticing the camera. After the visuals of medical professionals consuming alcohol in the dry state went viral, the Darbhanga Police sprung into action. Speaking with India Today TV, Darbhanga’s Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Amit Kumar confirmed the authenticity of the viral visuals. He stated that raids were conducted at DMCH after the video emerged, leading to the recovery of three bottles of foreign-made liquor. Kumar said, “It is claimed that a liquor party was organised on the DMCH campus. All video evidence will be examined and people concerned questioned.” Following the viral videos, opposition leaders launched a scathing attack on the Bihar government’s claim of making Bihar a dry state. Sharing photographs of the incident, Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) chief Pappu Yadav alleged that the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) served as an “adda for sharab, shabab and Kabab (hub for women, wine & dine)”. He also claimed that he saw it firsthand when he was taken for treatment while in jail.बिहार में ग़रीबों के शराबबंदी का अलग क़ानून है और DMCH के प्रिंसिपल और डॉक्टरों के लिए अलग क़ानून है क्या?दरभंगा में पेडिकॉन कांफ्रेंस में शराब परोसी जा रही थी। डॉक्टर लोग लुत्फ़ उठा रहे थे, प्रशासन सोई हुई थी, आख़िर कब तक यह चलेगा??मुख्यमंत्री जी @NitishKumar जी संज्ञान लें pic.twitter.com/vOIHVNGcRLAs per reports, the doctors caught in the viral frame included DMCH Principal Dr KN Mishra who outrightly denied the allegations. He claimed that he did not consume any alcohol and if anyone proves this, he will immediately leave his post. Regarding his presence at the alcohol party caught in the viral videos, he argued that someone had misused his photo and video as people could find his photo and video somewhere. According to him, the photo looks edited and he got information from news channels and newspapers. At the Pedicon conference, many doctors have come from Delhi, Mumbai, and Gujarat, for whom arrangements have been made to stay in many hotels and guest houses in the city. Now it is not possible to check their luggage, he further argued in his defence.He added that now that the incident has come to light, they are forming three to four investigation committees. This committee will investigate and submit a report in three days as to how and by whom the liquor was brought to the guest house. Presently Pedicon is going on in the guest house in which more than 509 doctors have come from outside. Regarding Pappu Yadav’s allegations of setting up a liquor den, the DMCH principal added that if any doctor is caught drinking or sees someone drinking then they should tell the hospital authorities. He added that the Pedicon is not an organisation of DMCH, it is organised by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP). In this institution, there are four times more doctors from outside Darbhanga than the number of doctors there, he added.It is important to note that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar imposed a ban on alcohol consumption in 2016, making it a dry state.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Content creators don’t appear to be stopping anytime soon even in the face of criticism from the public and constant reminders from the authorities. One such social media celebrity recently found herself in trouble when police intervened over a widely shared video of her dancing inside Mumbai’s railway stations. Instagram user Seema Kanojiya posted a video on her account issuing an apology for her illegal act.A post shared by Seema Kanojiya (@seemakanojiya87)She has now expressed regret for bothering the passengers. Seema Kanojiya recently released a clip surrounded by two police officers as she apologised for her objectionable behaviour. The dance video was uploaded on 2nd December by the social media influencer who has over 5.59 lakh Instagram followers. Since then, it has minted over 94.5 million views. She could be witnessed stepping off a stationary train while a Bollywood song plays in the background and running into two men who were crossing the platform. She began to dance on the platform and a large group gathered around her, leaving the men looking bewildered.She wrote, “Don’t make videos or reels at railway platforms and inside trains. Passengers face problems and it’s an offence. I’m sorry to make reels at the railway platform at Andheri and CSMT,” along with the footage of her apologising while a male and female police personnel stood on either side of her. She agreed that it was a legal offence to record such content on a train platform that caused inconvenience to other people and expressed surprise at the video’s popularity. She also implored other social media influencers to take note of her error and not repeat the mistake. A post shared by Seema Kanojiya (@seemakanojiya87)The Central Railway reacted in a tweet earlier after the footage of her leaping off a train and performing dance moves in front of guys on a railroad platform gained traction on social media. It read, “Passengers are requested to refrain from such activities which cause disturbance to other passengers. Under Railway Act sections 152 & 153, it’s a punishable offence with a penalty & imprisonment of up to 10 years for the charges of hurting/attempting to hurt other passengers.

Alliance with eighteen other anti-BJP parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and others.On 17th December, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s chief and Delhi’s Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, expressed his desire to contest all thirteen Lok Sabha seats in Punjab and one Lok Sabha seat in Chandigarh in the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections. Notably, AAP is part of I.N.D.I. Alliance with eighteen other anti-BJP parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and others.During a public meeting in Bathinda, Punjab, with Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, Arvind Kejriwal said, “All these parties are sad. They feel that their jobs have been taken away permanently. No one is going to vote for them again. The way [AAP formed] government three times in Delhi, you will give a majority vote to AAP in the next elections. Lok Sabha elections are not far away. There are 13 seats in Punjab and one seat in Chandigarh. My heart says the way people are getting benefitted; you should give all 13 seats to us and make us strong.”This is not the first time Congress and AAP have come face-to-face over seat sharing in Punjab. On 12th December, Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh Raja Warring said that his party would contest all 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab. Furthermore, he added that the high command had not given any instructions for contesting the upcoming General elections in any alliance.On 14th December, AAP chief spokesperson Malvinder Singh Kang said, “While the party high command’s final decision is to be taken, we are already preparing in all 13 Lok Sabha constituencies. The Chief Minister had declared in the Hoshiarpur rally that we will contest in all 13 seats.”Notably, Kejriwal’s statement came just two days before the I.N.D.I Alliance meeting that is scheduled for 19th December. This is going to be the first meeting of the alliance after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) defeated Congress in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh assembly elections. Following the defeat, Congress called for a meeting of its allies, which was first scheduled for the 6th of this month, before getting postponed to the 19th.

Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,"" Sardesai had claimed.Days after the Income Tax (IT) Department recovered a whopping ₹353 crore from the offices of Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai came to the rescue of the Congress MP.In a video posted on his YouTube channel on Friday (16th December), Sardesai claimed that the scam-tainted politician had no chance of being a Parliamentarian. While citing a make-believe ‘source’, he alleged that the Congress wanted to deny Sahu a ticket to the Rajya Sabha in 2018. The controversial ‘journalist’ claimed that the party relented after leaders, who have now defected to the BJP, lobbied for him. He also made reference to a ‘dead’ Congress leader who supposedly influenced the decision of the party to send Dhiraj Prasad Sahu to the Rajya Sabha.At a time when the grand-old-party is under scanner over allegations of corruption, Rajdeep Sardesai was seen making a last-ditch effort to give a clean chit to the Congress’ high command.“A senior Congress leader from Jharkhand claims Sahu was to be denied a ticket in 2018 but he reportedly managed to get his Rajya Sabha nomination at the very last moment with the help of a very key people in the Congress hierarchy in the National Capital,” he was heard saying.“Among his key benefactors is someone who is no longer alive and held the purse strings of the Congress for a very long time. Interestingly some of the others who also helped him have now switched to the BJP,” Sardesai brazened out.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress from Jharkhand. His family has been associated with the Congress party since independence. He became RS MP in by-polls in 2009 for the first time. In 2010, he was elected as RS MP for the second time; in 2018, he was re-elected for RS by Congress for the third time. He actively participates in parliamentary proceedings. Sahu was part of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra. In recent raids at Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd, where Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner, the Income Tax Department recovered ₹353 cr of unaccounted cash.

Alliance partner Congress",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/aap-contest-13-seats-punjab-leaving-0-for-partner-congress/,"Pratap Simha said that the previous government led by former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had already proposed to name Mysuru airport after Nalwadi Krishnaraja WadiyarOn 16th December, Pratap Simha, the Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Mysuru-Kodagu in Karnataka strongly objected to the Congress party’s suggestion to rename the Mysuru airport in honour of Tipu Sultan, the Islamist monarch of the 18th century. He criticised the proposal saying that the formal procedure to name the airport after Mysuru’s 20th-century king Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar was already almost finalised.He responded by calling the proposal to name it after Tipu Sultan ridiculous and pointing out that the airport had previously received approval to be renamed in commemoration of Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar.The BJP leader disclosed in a statement that he had earlier recommended that the Mysuru airport be renamed “Sri Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar Airport” in May 2022. He further maintained that the cabinet had accepted the same and that Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had requested that Rs 35 crore be allotted for the airport’s runway development.He conveyed, “The Cabinet also approved this nomination. The previous government led by former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had already proposed to name Mysuru airport after Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar. He subsequently wrote to the Centre on August 1, 2022, making the recommendation. The union government will soon make an official statement about the name, and it is in the final stages. It is unfair for Congress to create such confusion among people by passing unruly statements.”Furthermore, he charged that Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is attempting to cater to a particular community in the Mysuru area. “Siddaramaiah has no respect for Yaduvansha. During his first term, Siddarmaaiah permitted Tipu Jayanti to hurt the feelings of the people of Mysuru and Kodavas when they were against it. Congress is trying to appease a community for their vote bank politics by twisting the history. I will not allow the Congress to rename Mysuru Airport after Tipu Sultan.” “Who is he trying to appease by elevating Tipu Sultan as a heroic figure,” the parliamentarian asked. He announced, “Under no circumstances will I permit Mysuru airport to be named after Tipu Sultan. I will steadfastly support the sentiments of the people of Mysuru-Kodagu, who unanimously desire the airport to be named after Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. I stand as their voice, unwavering in my stance.” Congress MLA Prasad Abbayya from Hubballi-Dharwad (East) came up with the proposal of renaming the Mysuru airport after Tipu Sultan during a discussion about the state government writing to the Centre to change the names of airports. “I am 101 per cent still defend my decision demanding the Mysuru Airport to be named after Tipu Sultan. He gave Dalits and backward classes respect in society. Tipu Sultan brought the Land Reforms Act and helped backward-class people. I am a fan of Tipu Sultan. There is no need to appease any community,” he claimed while defending his controversial decision.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Sourav Chakraborty, who hails from West Bengal, said he had known Jha since May 2014 and had met him via Facebook. However, he never knew what Jha was planning.Chakraborty said, “We met on Facebook. He used to like and comment on my posts on social media. He used to support me in my Facebook posts. I have known him since May 14, but he never told me anything along these lines (Parliament security breach incident).” He further stated that if the incident had taken place “before 1947”, he would have supported it. He called it an “unnecessary” act now. He said, “He (Jha) used to speak about social justice and welfare. He never told me or hinted at such a kind of plan.” Lalit Jha and Chakraborty met in Kolkata during two rallies. Jha had helped Chakraborty in making arrangements for a rally in Uttar Pradesh.Reports suggest that Jha had sought Rs 7 lakh from his father a few months ago. A team from Baheda Police Station questioned his parents at their house in district Danbanga of Bihar. During questioning, his father, Devanant Jha, said he was informed about Lalit’s arrest via phone by Delhi Police on 15th December.The police also checked his mobile phone and asked about some photos and videos stored on the device. Lalit’s father said in a statement that he had asked for Rs 7 lakh a few months back. He claimed to have cleared the NEET exam and sought money for admission to a private college as his rank was low. However, due to his financial condition, Devanand could not help his son. He claimed his son was innocent and urged police not to take any strict action against him.On 14th December, the 22nd anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack, a major security breach occurred when two intruders entered the Lok Sabha chamber from the visitor gallery during Zero Hour.

"17 December, 2023 ","Karnataka: BJP MP Pratap Simha slams Congress MLA’s proposal to rename Mysuru Airport after Tipu Sultan, says the name “Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar Airport” was...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-mp-pratap-simha-slams-congress-mlas-proposal-to-rename-mysuru-airport-after-tipu-sultan/,"Slamming the Biden government, several netizens shared the Biden couple’s earlier “decency” posts along with obscene pictures of LGBTQ+ activists outside the White House as well as scandalous pictures of Hunter Biden with seemingly minor kids or banned substances. The US Capitol has recently been rocked by a porn scandal involving one of the legal aides of Democratic Senator Ben Cardin who has now been fired. As per US media reports, a staffer named Aidan Maese-Czeropski associated with Cardin’s office filmed himself while copulating with a man in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. The scandal came to light on Friday (15th December) after the video was leaked online.The 8-second graphic video was published by the Daily Caller on Friday. The video was embedded in an article authored by Henry Rodgers, who reported that the video was initially shared in a group chat for gay men in politics. The video appears to show a pair of men copulating in Hart 216, the same room where the 9/11 commission hearings were held and former FBI Director James Comey delivered testimony about Donald Trump in 2017. After media reports surfaced, the United States Capitol Police initiated an investigation into potential criminal violations when the video started circulating.Meanwhile, initially, Cardin’s office declined to comment on the video, calling it a “personnel matter.” But on Saturday (16th December), his office confirmed to Politico that Maese-Czropski “is no longer employed by the U.S. Senate.” A spokeswoman from Cardin’s office told The New York Post, “Aidan Maese-Czeropski is no longer employed by the U.S. Senate. We will have no further comment on this personnel matter.” Although the Daily Caller which published the graphic video did not identify the two men caught in the leaked video, several conservative outlets identified Aidan Maese-Czropski, Maryland Democrat Senator Ben Cardin’s aide, as one of the participants caught in the obscene video. NYT reported that Maese-Czeropski, a 24-year-old legislative aide, was accused of posting a video of himself in flagrante delicto with another man on a public X account. His face appeared to be clearly visible, according to The Spectator, which first broke the story on Friday. Following the reports, Maese-Czropski on Friday, in a cryptic post on LinkedIn, claimed that while “some of my actions in the past have shown poor judgement,” he would “never disrespect [his] workplace.” He, however, did not make any reference to the video.Alleging that he is being attacked for a ‘political agenda’, his post read, “This has been a difficult time for me, as I have been attacked for who I love to pursue a political agenda. While some of my actions in the past have shown poor judgement, I love my job and would never disrespect my workplace. Any attempts to characterize my actions otherwise are fabricated and I will be exploring what legal options are available to me in these matters.”Additionally, on Friday, Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio) told the Daily Caller that Maese-Czeropski was the staffer who approached him and said “free Palestine” during an interview with NBC News earlier this week. While responding to the claims that he yelled ‘Free Palestine’ slogans at a Jewish Congressman in the Capitol hallway, Maese-Czropski noted in his LinkedIn post, “As for the accusations regarding Congressman Max Miller, I have never seen the congressman and had no opportunity or cause to yell or confront him.”  Moreover, according to his LinkedIn profile, he has been employed in Cardin’s office since October 2021. Before this role, he served as a field organiser for the Democratic Party in Virginia and worked as a climate researcher for the charity Friends of the Earth.NYT further reported that Maese-Czeropski had previously featured in an ad for President Biden which earned Biden a shoutout from his mother’s now-deleted X account. In a November 2020 post, his mother said, “Thank you for including my son, Aidan Maese-Czeropski, in your thoughtful message to everyone who has supported you. He has worked tirelessly with the DNC of Virginia. Congratulations to All!!” The same year, Maese-Czeropski reportedly wrote on the payment platform Venmo, “I want Joe Biden to spit in my mouth.”Republican leaders and netizens launched a scathing attack on the Biden administration with many of them re-sharing old “decency” posts by the most powerful couple in the US, Joe and Jill Biden. Taking to X, Republican George Santos wrote, “Having sex in a United States government building and filming it is the reason you got heat. You being gay and having gay s*x NO BODY gives a rats a*s.” Having sex in a United States government building and filming it is the reason you got heat.You being gay and having gay sex NO BODY gives a rats ass…No one is perusing a political agenda, we are just disgusted about your VILE behavior as a staffer to a United States… pic.twitter.com/UfHfjTDCj8On December 15 2023 the most vile and unimaginable thing took place in our nations Capitol it was an organized and well planned SexErection.

"17 December, 2023 ",Parliament Security Breach: Lalit Jha shared the video of the intrusion with a friend from Bengal urging him to circulate it,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/lalit-jha-parliament-security-breach-friend-bengal-video/,"The Railway project was discussed between King Wangchuck and PM Modi during the King's visit to India in early November. On 17th December, King of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, highlighted the recently announced railway project between India and Bhutan in his National Day address. The railway project is set to connect Gelephu in Bhutan to Kokrajhar in Assam, India. It is aimed to improve diplomatic and economic relations between the two neighbouring countries.Watch: During national day address, Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck mentions the first ever Bhutan India Railway connect; thanks PM Modi & India govt for supporting the project. pic.twitter.com/sQz2KGqP2qSpeaking on the National Day, King Wangchuck said, “Around 2 billion people in South Asia…It’s a period of awakening for the region, a period of growth, a period of immense opportunities.” Furthermore, he thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India for the Railway project, connectivity and support for the project.Bhutan celebrated its 116th National Day on 17th December. On this day, the first King of Bhutan, Gongsar Ugyen Wangchuck, was coronated in 1907, marking the country’s unification.The Railway project was discussed between King Wangchuck and PM Modi during the King’s visit to India in early November. It is being touted as King’s legacy as it will reshape the regional landscape by improving connectivity, trade and economic cooperation between India and Bhutan. It will also improve employment in Bhutan. Reportedly, Bhutan is facing a brain drain as many youths are opting to leave the country and settle abroad in countries like Australia. During his address, the King emphasised improving up-skilling in the country.The Indian Railways has already completed the Preliminary Engineering-cum-Traffic (PET) survey for the project. Furthermore, plans are underway to upgrade the existing Land Customs station at Dadgiri in Assam to an integrated Check Post as part of the project. Similar upgrades are being planned at Gelephu in Bhutan to ensure a seamless trade environment.Once completed, further possibilities to extend the project to Banarhat in West Bengal and Samtse in Bhutan will be explored.In November, the joint statement issued by India and Bhutan read, “During the visit to Assam, Hon’ble Governor of Assam Shri Gulab Chand Kataria hosted a dinner in honour of His Majesty. Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma, called on His Majesty and discussed a wide range of issues, including rail connectivity, cross-border trade infrastructure, economic cooperation, tourism, education, skill development, environmental conservation, and nurturing people-to-people connections.To further expand bilateral cooperation on trade, technology, cross-border connectivity, mutual investments, education and people-to-people connections, the following was agreed upon:To undertake the Final Location Survey (FLS), in consultation with the Bhutanese side, of the proposed cross-border rail link connecting Kokrajhar in Assam to Gelephu in Bhutan through GoI support. The two sides noted successful completion of the Preliminary Engineering-cum-Traffic (PET) survey of the rail-link by Indian Railways. The two sides also agreed to consider establishing rail-link between Banarhat (West Bengal) and Samtse (Bhutan).To designate Darranga (Assam)/Samdrup Jongkhar (Bhutan) as immigration check post between Bhutan and India to facilitate the entry and exit of third country nationals by land route for enhancing connectivity, and promoting tourism.GOI to positively consider Bhutan’s request for concessional financing in the area of skill development and capacity building under the GyalSung Project.To designate Haldibari (West Bengal) – Chilahati (Bangladesh) rail route as an additional trade route for Bhutan’s trade with Bangladesh.”In August this year, Minister of External Affairs, Dr S Jaishankar, had talked about the said railway project. Addressing the media, Dr Jaishankar emphasised on the importance of enhancing trade and tourism opportunities with Bhutan via the railway link.Notably, while Bhutan-India relations continue to thrive, the situation is quite the opposite when it comes to the relations between Bhutan and its other neighbour, China. Relations between them have been deteriorating over the years because of the land disputes. In 2021, it was reported that China had established a new village in the south of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and named it Gyalaphug in Tibetan or Jieluobu in Chinese. China has been developing the 232-square-mile area with settlers, security personnel, and military infrastructure originally belonging to Bhutan. The new construction commenced under President Xi Jinping’s significant drive along Himalayan frontiers.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ",King of Bhutan thanks PM Modi and India for support in rail network during his National Day address,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bhutans-king-thanks-india-pm-modi-support-railway-project-national-day/,"By spending a night at Ujjain, MP CM Mohan Yadav broke the myth that only one king can stay there, and Lord Mahakal is considered the king of the city. However, Yadav said that he is not king but a servant of the LordFrom breaking records to myths, the Bhartiya Janata Party has been ahead of its rivals as seen in the recent electoral victories in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. In this line, BJP leader and the new Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav has broken the “Ujjain jinx” on Saturday (December 16).Dr. Mohan Yadav visited Ujjain after being sworn in as Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh on December 13 and performed ‘Rudrabhishek’ at Mahakaleshwar Temple. However, contrary to popular belief, the newly-elected chief minister returned to his residence in Ujjain and stayed the night, shocking everyone.On Saturday, CM Yadav attended the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra (VBSY) in Ujjain. Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with and addressed the beneficiaries of the VBSY via video conferencing. Notably, VBSY recently completed its one month. ""विकास की ये लहर, पहुंचेगी हर गांव हर शहर""  आदरणीय प्रधानमंत्री श्री @narendramodi जी के विकसित भारत के संकल्‍प को पूरा करने में हम कोई कसर नहीं छोड़ेंगे। आज महाकाल की नगरी उज्‍जैन से #विकसित_भारत_संकल्प_यात्रा को हरी झंडी दिखाकर रवाना किया। pic.twitter.com/X5wAjpKnZcIt’s worth noting that Ujjain has an old myth that only one ‘Raja’ can spend the night here. And since Lord Mahakal is revered as ‘Ujjain’s Raja,’ no other chief or the ruler can spend the night here. It is claimed that if any head of state, chief minister, or prime minister spends a night in Ujjain, they will lose power and government. Interestingly, since Lord Mahakal is revered as the king of Ujjain, he is also given a Guard of Honour similar to the Guard of Honour given to “Ram Raja” daily in Orchha where Lord Ram is revered as the king.The Ujjain jinx holds prominence due to several instances wherein political leaders had to lose their constitutional post after spending the night in Ujjain. Interestingly, it is said that former Prime Minister Morarji Desai had spent a night in Ujjain back in 1979 and the very next day he had to resign mid-term. Similarly, former Karnataka CM Yediyurappa who is said to have stayed in Ujjain for nearly 20 days also lost power.Since Ujjain is CM Mohan Yadav’s hometown, he is aware of the prevalent myth. However, CM Yadav opines that he is not a Raja or king but a mere servant and son of Lord Mahakal. He said “I am no king, only Mahakal is the king. I am only his son. These myths are all pointless. I had instructed the collector to take me to KD Gate and then only I would go to my home. I can spend the night here as I have been a servant of Mahakal since childhood and was born here only, thus the myth does not apply to me.”जय श्री राम! pic.twitter.com/lexxvFS2KqCM Mohan Yadav also hinted that a cabinet meeting will also be held in Ujjain. This meeting could take place in January 2024.Before breaking the myth, CM Yadav while addressing a public gathering said that this myth was floated 211 years ago by the then-king Daulat Rao Scindia. CM Yadav further stated that after the death of Madhya Pradesh’s then-king, Mahadji Scindia, Daulat Rao Scindia intended to relocate the state capital from Ujjain to Gwalior. Due to this, he created this myth. He stated that because Ujjain has only one ruler, Baba Mahakal, two kings cannot stay there.While it is a matter of subjective interpretation of the occurrence of such incidents. Some may dismiss it as superstition and myth while others may hold their beliefs as true. However, several priests and saints are of the view that since this does not find any mention in the Hindu scriptures, it cannot be considered valid from the religious point of view.CM Mohan Yadav’s move warrants recalling the infamous “Noida jinx“. Yogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, broke the ‘Noida Jinx’ by visiting Noida in December 2017. This superstition began in 1988, shortly after former Chief Minister Vir Bahadur Singh lost power after visiting Noida. It was commonly believed that any chief minister who visited Noida would lose power. Despite the prevalence of this myth, the then newly-elected chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Noida to inaugurate metro projects and other development projects.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ",‘I am a servant of Mahakal’: Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav on breaking 211-year-old myth of Ujjain,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/madhya-pradesh-cm-mohan-yadav-breaks-211-year-old-myth-of-ujjain/,"The High Court has decided that Sarita's standing as the deceased's lawfully wedded wife is unaltered and allowed for her compassionate appointment.In Uttarakhand, a woman got her husband’s job after he died, even though a divorce case was going on. The Uttarakhand High Court awarded the woman named Sarita compassionate appointment, who had filed for divorce from her husband Hari Sevak because of their problematic relationship, reported The Times of India.Sarita filed for divorce in 2015, barely two years after the wedding in 2013, alleging that he used to abuse her. Her husband worked as a watchman at a Tuberculosis (TB) hospital in Nainital. However, he died in 2019 when he was 40 years before the legal battle was settled.Sarita promptly applied for a compassionate appointment in the post occupied by her late husband. Amit Kumar, Hari’s brother objected to the move and cited his right to the same because of the ongoing divorce proceedings. He also went to the High Court, but he also passed away in October. The High Court has now decided that Sarita’s standing as the deceased’s lawfully wedded wife is unaltered and allowed for her compassionate appointment.Sarita’s lawyer Prabhat Bohra informed, “Class 12 pass-out Sarita was married to Hari in February 2013 when she was 26. Hari was a heavy drinker and due to his habit, their relationship became so strained that Sarita was forced to file a divorce case in 2015.” He elaborated that the majority of family conflicts are settled through counselling at the mediation centre. Therefore, even after filing for divorce, the couple’s status as husband and wife is maintained by the courts until the matter is concluded.“For the compassionate appointment, the first and foremost claim is always of the wife of the deceased government servant. Moreover, the mess that her brother-in-law created, has now come to rest due to his demise. The hospital’s chief medical superintendent is directed to consider her claim for a compassionate appointment within six weeks,” the single bench of Justice Pankaj Purohit stated after considering the matter.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, he highlighted that in terms of the overall gems and jewelry sector, India’s share is only 3.5% in total export. He added that Surat has the potential to catapult India into double-digit figures, assuring that it is Modi’s guarantee that the government will be in its steadfast support. The PM noted that the Union government has already chosen this sector as a focus area for export. He listed out several measures taken by the Central government for the Diamond Industry, including promotion of patented design, diversification of export products, collaborating with other nations to improve the technology, and promotion of lab-grown or green diamonds. PM Modi added that the government has made special provisions for Green Diamond in the budget urging the people to make maximum utilisation of these measures.  Today, the global discourse is centered around India.'Made in India' has become an influential brand. pic.twitter.com/lp6zslx5XuPM Modi stated that the Union government has placed special emphasis on developing modern infrastructure in Surat. The city now boasts an International Airport, a metro rail service, and a coastal port capable of handling large cargo, including the Hazira port, a deep-sea LNG terminal, and a multi-cargo port. Surat is also becoming connected to international trading ports, a feature limited to very few cities globally.

In a horrifying incident in Bihar’s Gopalganj, a priest (Pujari) of a Shiv Temple, who had been missing for the last five days, has been brutally murdered. The deceased victim has been identified as Manoj Kumar Sah. The matter pertains to Danapur village in the Manjhagarh police station area. The mutilated body of the victim, with his eyes gouged out, and tongue and genitals chopped off, was recovered in the bushes near a dairy shop on Saturday (December 16). The 32-year-old victim was also shot with a bullet near the neck.Reports say that the victim’s brother Ashok Kumar Sah has been a village head, and is a local Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) leader (Mandal President). Ashok said that his brother went missing five days ago and that they had filed a missing persons complaint as well on December 11, however, the police did not take any concrete action despite giving assurance that they will find Manoj within hours. The victim’s family had raised suspicion that Manoj might have been abducted. After the victim’s mutilated body was found, the infuriated villagers staged a protest accusing the police of inaction in the matter. The protestors even blocked National Highway 27. Subsequently, Sadar SDPO Pranjal arrived at the protest site and tried to pacify the agitated locals. Meanwhile, heavy police force was called in to control the situation. The police have said that an FIR has been registered in the killing of the temple priest and an investigation into the matter is underway.Notably, the police have not made any arrests so far and the motive behind the brutal murder also remains undisclosed. However, the victim’s brother Ashok has said that attempts were being made by some people to grab the temple’s land. He added that whenever any program or event was organised at the temple, the people belonging to another community raised objections. Moreover, Ashok said that his brother, who had been taking care of the temple for the last five years, was quite disturbed as some land bought for the temple was grabbed by the accused who used it for farming. He added that his brother was also getting death threats for some time.माझागढ़ थाना अंतर्गत मनोज कुमार साह की मृत्यु से संबंधित अपडेट@bihar_police @BiharHomeDept @DigSaran @swarnprabhat516 #HainTaiyaarHum pic.twitter.com/3iNcdl1wb2According to the CCTV footage recovered from the cameras installed in the Temple, the victim was last seen stepping out of the temple after locking the room at around 12:40 AM on December 10.

"17 December, 2023 ","Eyes gouged out, genitals mutilated, tongue chopped off: Shiv Temple Pujari, who was missing in Bihar for 5 days, found dead",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bihar-pujari-shot-dead-in-gopalganj-dead-body-mutilated-missing/," The victim reported that Farooq Abbas Pathan, a resident of her village for the past two months, had been persistently stalking her.On Sunday (17th December), Gujarat police reported that a Hindu woman, in a village in the Kheda district, was subjected to a brutal assault by Farooq Pathan after she refused to engage in an affair with him. Accused Farooq Pathan tried to even behead the victim woman on Thursday (14th December). The victim is currently hospitalised at SVP Hospital in Ahmedabad, while the accused, Farooq Pathan is absconding. A police complaint has been filed, leading to the registration of a case. The police launched an investigation into this case.The incident took place in Sanadara village within the Galateshwar taluka of Kheda. The 33-year-old victim, residing in this village, got married in 2010 to a man from a nearby village. However, due to a dispute with her husband, she has been residing at her father’s house for the last three years. She is the mother of an 8-year-old son.According to her official complaint, the victim reported that Farooq Abbas Pathan, a resident of her village for the past two months, had been persistently stalking and pressuring her to engage in a romantic relationship. Despite her repeated refusals, Farooq continued to pursue her, insisting on initiating a love affair.On Thursday (14th December), at approximately 7 AM, Farooq Pathan abruptly approached the victim, hurling verbal abuse at her, including caste-related insulting remarks. Armed with a knife, Farooq Pathan attacked the victim’s neck. The victim tried to save herself with her hands during the assault. Consequently, serious wounds were inflicted on her wrists by the sharp-edged weapon.At the time of the attack, the victim was accompanied by her sister-in-law. Farooq Pathan also targeted the sister-in-law, attempting to cause physical harm to her, the victim’s son, and father. He then fled from there. The family members also rushed to the spot and moved the victim to the local hospital.Subsequently, she was transferred to SVP Hospital in Ahmedabad, following a referral, where necessary procedures and operations were conducted. Currently, the victim is receiving medical treatment and remains hospitalised.The Sewalia police have initiated legal proceedings by filing a case under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, including sections 326 (voluntarily causing hurt by weapon), 504 (insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 506(2) (criminal intimidation). Additionally, Section 135 of the Gujarat Police Act and various sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have been invoked. A comprehensive investigation is underway. The accused, Farooq Pathan, remains unapprehended as of the time of writing this report. OpIndia has a copy of the First Information Report (FIR).Speaking to OpIndia about the incident, one of the victim’s family members said, “He tried to slit her throat, but her wrists received serious cut injuries as she tried to shield her neck with her hands. Her thumb had a narrow escape when he attacked for the second time with that knife.”According to the family member, Farooq threatened to kidnap the victim’s son on his way to school and kill him, as well as the entire family. The family has now lodged a police complaint.Hindu organisations also rushed to the aid of the victim’s family after learning about the incident. Bhavesh Kansara, a Bajrang Dal worker from Ahmedabad, told OpIndia, “We rushed to the hospital along with our workers when the incident was reported. We are discussing what to do next after getting the details from the family. Our only aim is that the family should get justice and there should be awareness among the people on this issue and Hindu daughters should avoid getting trapped.” He added that Farooq’s family had also approached the victim’s family and talked about a solution, but they have categorically refused.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The organisation has been at the helm of anti-India propaganda since 2019 in cahoots with communists, Kashmiri separatists and anti-Hindu activists.As per a report by the Washington Examiner, ‘The People’s Forum’ received a whopping $4.4 million (~₹36.53 crores) in 2022 while it could rake in only $4,86,900 (~₹4.04 crores) a year earlier.The US news outlet reviewed the tax forms of the Singham-financed organisation and found that there has been an 803% increase in funds amassed by it in a year-long period.According to the Washington Examiner, The People’s Forum received about $4 million (~₹33.2 crores) in grants and contributions in 2022. A review of the organisation’s financial disclosures also revealed that it made $52000 (~₹43.18 lakhs) in investment and $3,31,000 (~₹2.74 crores) in program service revenue.At the same time, its assets were valued at $18.5 million (~₹153 crores).

Its office and studio space lease contracts were valued at $343,000 (~₹ 2.84 crores)“The flood of cash to the People’s Forum underscores how far-left organizations boosting China and other overseas interests have gained significant footing in the U.S. in recent years,” the Washington Examiner emphasised.According to the US news outlet, the Neville Roy Singham-financed organisation gained IRS (Internal Revenue Service) tax-exempt status in 2017 i.e. it is not required to pay federal corporate tax on its income.Given that it is registered as a ‘charity’, The People’s Forum is not obligated to report its donors to the public. Washington Examiner reached out to the general manager of the organisation, David Chung, via email but he did not comment on the matter.While speaking about the development, Republican leader Elise Stefanik said, “I support immediately investigating the People’s Forum and organizations like it to determine what level of funding and coordination these pro-Hamas rallies have received from America’s adversaries.Washington Examiner pointed out, “Foreign policy experts and members of Congress have recently raised concerns about the People’s Forum having tax-exempt status, particularly as it boosts Hamas.”OpIndia has found that ‘The People’s Forum’ has been peddling anti-India narratives since 2019. It has been organising teach-in sessions, seminars and movie screenings since 2019 to disseminate a distorted idea of Jammu and Kashmir to its global audience. The Chinese Communist Party stooge-backed organisation has openly called for the secession of the integral part of the Indian territory and extended support to extremist elements, calling for ‘Azadi.’ ‘The People’s Forum reiterated pro-Pakistani talking points about Kashmir, referring to the region as ‘Indian Occupied.’ August 5 marks 4 years since India’s complete annexation of Kashmir—Author Hafsa Kanjwal & @mjunaidr will also discuss recent developments in the region.In Sep 2019, the People’s Forum conducted a ‘teach-in session’ dubbed ‘Self-Determination and Solidarity in Kashmir.’ The anti-India event was sponsored by the likes of ‘Codepink’, founded by Neville Roy Singham’s wife Jodie Evans.It has also held the screening of a propaganda film titled ‘Khoon Diy Baarav’ and promoted a book, written by ‘ISI operative’ Hafsa Kanjwal, and titled ‘Colonising Kashmir: State Building under Indian Occupation.’“August 5 marks 4 years since India’s complete annexation of Kashmir—Author Hafsa Kanjwal & Mohamad Junaid will also discuss recent developments in the region,” The People’s Forum lamented the abrogation of Article 370.‘The People’s Forum’ appeared fascinated with Communist hardliners such as EMS Namboodiripad.

Interestingly, the book is written by a Communist Party of India (Marxist) politician Thomas Isaac.The uncanny obsession with Kerala did not end with praising the Communist Party of India’s make-believe governance model. ‘The People’s Forum’ appeared fascinated with Communist hardliners such as EMS Namboodiripad who infamously called Mahatma Gandhi a ‘Hindu fundamentalist.’On August 5 this year, The New York Times published a detailed article, revealing the ties of Neville Roy Singham with the Chinese government and his financial support to an Indian leftist propaganda outlet NewsClick.The New York Times pointed out that Singham has been successful in disseminating Chinese government talking points under the pretext of ‘progressive advocacy’ in countries such as India, Brazil, South Africa and the United States.During its investigation, the American newspaper found that Neville Roy Singham had financed an India-based leftist propaganda outlet named NewsClick. “In New Delhi, corporate filings show, Mr. Singham’s network financed a news site, NewsClick, that sprinkled its coverage with Chinese government talking points. “China’s history continues to inspire the working classes,” one video said,” noted The New York Times.It was later revealed that Neville Roy Singham had close ties with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Prakash Karat. Emails exchanged between NewsClick owner Prabir Purkayastha and Neville Roy Singham show that the latter instructed the former on ways to report the India-China border dispute and China’s handling of COVID-19.

Following the attack, Israel launched a counter-attack on Hamas to wipe out the terror outfit from the face of the Earth. Initially, Israel hit Hamas locations in Gaza via air strikes. Later, a ground attack by Israeli forces was started to eliminate Hamas terrorists. Hamas is known for using civilians as human shields. When the Palestinians tried to flee the Gaza Strip after IDF urged them to evacuate to save themselves from Israeli air strikes, Hamas reportedly forcefully stopped the civilians. Furthermore, they established underground bunkers across the Gaza Strip, especially under hospitals and schools, as a countermeasure against Israeli forces, as they knew Israel would hesitate in attacking such establishments.

"17 December, 2023 ",Don’t underestimate the seriousness of the Indian Parliament security breach: PM Narendra Modi,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/dont-underestimate-parliament-security-breach-pm-narendra-modi/,"The accused businessman has been charged under Sections 376 (rape), 354 (assault or use of criminal force on a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal CodeOn Wednesday (13th December), a complaint of rape was filed against Sajjan Jindal, managing director of the JSW Group, by an actress at BKC police station in Mumbai. The complainant said that the crime took place in January 2022 in the penthouse of the head office of the company located in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). According to the complainant, the police did not book any case despite the complaint being lodged earlier in 2023. Now, this case is registered after the court ordered to book an FIR.According to the victim woman’s statement, she initially encountered Jindal in October 2021 in Dubai, where they were both present in the VIP box of a stadium, enjoying an IPL match. Subsequently, they crossed paths in Jaipur during the wedding of MP Praful Patel’s son. The actress claimed that Jindal’s behaviour turned increasingly intimate and intrusive following their meeting in Mumbai. Despite her repeated rejections of his advances, she alleged that Jindal ultimately forced himself upon her.She said in her complaint, “We had exchanged numbers and met in Mumbai because he had expressed interest in buying property from my brother who is a real estate consultant in Dubai. He started addressing me as ‘babe’ and ‘baby’, and described all the problems in his marriage when we first met alone, which made me very awkward.” She further mentioned that gestures such as hugs and flirtatious advances on his part contributed to her discomfort.The complainant stated that in their subsequent text message exchanges, Jindal conveyed romantic feelings towards her, notwithstanding his marital status. She mentioned, “He also tried to kiss me and talked about getting physically intimate, which I shot down, saying that could happen only after we were married.”According to her complaint, in January 2022, during a meeting at the company’s headquarters, Jindal escorted the actress to the penthouse. Despite her persistent protests and refusals, she claimed, that Jindal imposed himself on her. The complainant mentioned that despite the incident, she attempted to sustain a friendship with him. However, he ceased responding to her and eventually blocked her number. She said, “Before blocking my number in June 2022, he threatened me with dire consequences if I approached the police.”In February 2023, she submitted a written complaint to the BKC police, but as per the actress, her repeated complaints were ignored. She said, “I approached the police on February 16, 2023. They barely scribbled down a rough statement. They didn’t even give me a copy of that statement. No FIR was filed. Finally, on December 5, 2023, I filed a writ petition against the police in Bombay High Court.” Consequently, she sought legal recourse and approached the Bombay High Court, which mandated the BKC police to officially register the complaint. According to an official from the BKC police, the accused businessman has been charged under Sections 376 (rape), 354 (assault or use of criminal force on a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, based on the actress’s statements. He stated that ongoing investigations are being conducted into the matter.DCP Deekshitkumar Gedam said, “Mumbai Police is doing everything legally as per procedure. There wasn’t any delay from our side in filing the FIR. We take matters related to women’s safety very seriously. We are following the legal course of action in the matter.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

The Prime Minister added that the investigating authorities are looking into the matter and will find out the motive behind the attack. This comes after accused Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan jumped into the Lok Sabha well on December 13 from the visitors’ gallery while the proceedings were going on and released yellow-coloured smoke from canisters.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ","Sajjan Jindal of the JSW group booked in a rape case filed by an actress, FIR registered in Mumbai after court order",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/sajjan-jindal-md-jsw-group-booked-rape-case-actress/,"The Cardinal risked up to seven years in prison after being indicted with two charges of embezzlement stemming from the London transactionFormer adviser to Pope Francis, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu was found guilty of financial fraud and given a five-and-a-half-year prison sentence by a Vatican criminal court on 16th December. Cardinal Becciu was also handed a fine of €8,000. He is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be charged with such an offence. The 75-year-old was involved in a legal dispute, along with nine other individuals, linked to a real estate transaction in the London area that caused substantial economic damages to the Roman Catholic Church.Once considered a papal contender, the charges against Angelo Becciu made him the first cardinal ever to be tried for financial crimes. During a two and a half year trial, his nine co-defendants were found not guilty on nearly fifty of the accusations against them whereas he was cleared of several more violations. Cardinal Becciu claimed he had been directed to quit his high-ranking position within the Catholic Church in 2020 by the Pope following the publication of an Italian news magazine, L’Espresso, which revealed an inquiry into possible fraudulent transactions. “Until 6:02 p.m. on Thursday, I felt like a friend of the Pope, a faithful executor of his will. Then the Pope says he no longer has faith in me,” he informed in an interview at the time.Giuseppe Pignatone, the president of the court, pronounced the decision and charged him with embezzlement, abuse of office and tampering with witnesses. Cardinal Becciu has refuted the accusations and his attorney declared that he is going to bring an appeal against the sentence. The verdict, according to prosecutor Alessandro Diddi, “showed we were correct.”The trial centred on the 350 million euro investment made by the Vatican Secretariat of State to convert an old Harrods’ warehouse into deluxe residences. The government of the Vatican City was allegedly defrauded of tens of millions of euros in fees and commissions by Vatican monsignors and brokers, per the prosecution, and then demanded 15 million euros from it in exchange for giving up ownership of the structure.While he was a senior official in the Vatican’s Secretariat of State, the majority of the accusations focused on his “highly speculative” purchase of an opulent home at 60 Sloane Avenue in Chelsea, a wealthy neighbourhood of London. The property was later sold for a loss of at least €140 million ($152 million).The Cardinal risked up to seven years in prison after being indicted with two charges of embezzlement stemming from the London transaction. Ultimately, he was adjudged culpable of theft stemming from the Vatican’s initial 200 million euro investment in 2014 into a fund that obtained a 45% stake in the London building. The tribunal found that making such a speculative transaction using church assets was forbidden under canon law.Cardinal Becciu, who was the Vatican’s Substitute for General Affairs at the time and essentially the Pope’s chief of staff, approved the entire arrangement.Prosecutors accused Cardinal Becciu of larceny after the first London probe yielded additional charges after he paid a Sardinian woman named Cecilia Marogna €575,000 ($627,000) for her intelligence services, and transferred €125,000 ($136,000) of Vatican money to a foundation in Sardinia. The money was reportedly misused by her to finance trips and the purchase of upscale items.The woman received a three years and nine months sentence. Regarding the first charge, the Cardinal contended that the money was requested by the local bishop and was retained by the church to fund charitable endeavours. In response to the latter, he alleged that he believed the funds would be used to hire a security firm to broker the release of a nun who had been kidnapped in 2017 by al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists in Mali.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"17 December, 2023 ",Parliament security breach: Police recovers burnt mobile phones of the accused from Rajasthan,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parliament-security-breach-police-recovers-burnt-mobile-phones-of-the-accused-from-rajasthan/," The family alleged that Ashwajit was nowhere in the frame when Singh fell from the car and injured herself, as shown by the CCTV footage accessed by the police.On 16th December, Ashwajit Gaikwad’s family issued an official statement refuting allegations of his alleged girlfriend. Gaikwad has been accused of mowing down 26-year-old Priya Singh in Thane, Maharashtra with his SUV. As per the statement, when the incident happened, Singh was allegedly intoxicated, and Ashwajit was at a family get-together with his wife, kids, and friends.The family stated that the incident occurred between 1:30 AM and 2 AM. On the other hand, Singh claimed the incident occurred around 4 AM. The statement reads that Singh was continuously messaging Ashwajit, wanting to meet him. She reached the Courtyard Hotel, where the family was having a party, and barged into it. “Yes, she did barge where Ashwajit was with his friends and family,” the family added.The family further added that Priya Singh was intoxicated. She allegedly hit and abused Ashwajit and his friends as he was not “responding to her calls and texts at midnight”. The statement read, “Might be there was a past between the two, but Ashwajit maintains he and she were just friends. Now Ashwajit also claims that he has paid her money on several occasions; even if he was in a relationship with her then, they must have broken up recently.”Explaining what happened at night, the statement read, “When she (Priya Singh) started hitting him and his friends, Ashwajit and his family fled from the spot in his car with his family, totally embarrassed! She then clung to his driver’s car, and the driver, too, wanted to leave as his boss had already left. But then, as soon as the driver sped, she fell off, and in the process, she hurt herself badly as it was a moving car which she clung on to.”When the driver noticed that Singh fell, he immediately rushed her to the nearest hospital and completed all the formalities. The statement added, “When they thought they had informed the patient’s sister and handed her all her valuables, next comes that this madam, with all her injuries, has changed the hospital. God knows who got in touch with whom, and a local rival reached the spot and thought it was the best chance to get back to Gaikwad in all family rivalry.”Furthermore, the family alleged that Ashwajit was nowhere in the frame when Singh fell from the car and injured herself, as shown by the CCTV footage accessed by the police. The family further pointed out that the incident described by Singh in her Instagram post and FIR were contradictory. They said, “In one, she blames Ashwajit, and in the other, it is said the driver dashed her.”The statement noted, “Yes, whatever happened in the past is between the boy and the girl. If things don’t go right, or if the relationship goes kaput, why is the boy always to be blamed? Just because he is a son and nephew of a famous person, so what? Just because he is monetarily strong, does the girl have the right to do anything? …She claims Ashwajit bit her. Has that been mentioned in any report from the hospital?” They further questioned if Singh was tested for alcohol.On the other hand, speaking to PTI, Singh claimed that she did not know that Ashwajit was married. She said, “When I came to know (that he was married), he told me that they (his wife and him) were not together anymore; they had separated. He said that he wanted to marry me. I was staying with him for a long time.” She added, “When I went to meet him that night, he was with his wife. I was in shock when I went to talk to him; he got aggressive. We fought.”On 15th December, social media influencer Priya Singh published a post on her Instagram account accusing Ashwajit Gaikwad, son of Anil Gaikwad, the Managing Director of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, of allegedly mowing her down outside a hotel in Thane. In her post, she alleged that on 11th December, Ashwajit called her to meet at a hotel where he was at a function along with his friends. She alleged he behaved strangely, and when she tried to talk to him privately, he and his friends began hurling verbal abuses at the victim. When Priya asked her boyfriend to defend her, he allegedly slapped and tried to strangulate her.As the situation started getting worse, she headed to retrieve her bag and phone from the SUV, but the perpetrators allegedly attempted to cause her serious harm by first driving the SUV into her back near a divider, then returning and driving it over her right leg before speeding away. She was admitted to the hospital by his driver, Sagar, who allegedly threatened her not to complain about it. The accused were booked under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 279 (rash driving on a public way) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by Kasarvadavali police. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The High Court asked for a policy within a week. CM Bhagwant Mann is the jail minister. What did he do?… Drug tablets are being sold inside the jails… If I am proven a liar, I will leave politics,” Sidhu said, speaking to reporters on Saturday.The Punjab and Haryana High Court has recently sought a status report from the Punjab and Haryana governments on the steps taken after the BSF gave a list of 75 individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking to the Punjab Police.The High Court took cognizance of a news article published in an English newspaper that mentioned that the Border Security Force (BSF) gave a list of 75 individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking to the Punjab Police.Moreover, the High Court has made the Punjab and Haryana governments and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) parties in this case and has issued a notice and ordered them to file their replies.According to the data released by BSF, BSF has seized around 755 kg of narcotics so far in the year 2023. 95 drones coming from Pakistan have been shot down. 36 Pakistani nationals have been arrested, of whom 15 rifles and 38 pistols have been recovered. In addition to this, nine Pakistanis who were trying to cross the border have been killed.“The State of Punjab is directed to file a status report with respect to the steps being taken in pursuance of the report given to it by the BSF.

The Odisha government has compiled an exclusive guest list comprising prominent VIPs, corporate leaders, and celebrities for the upcoming grand event in Puri.The Odisha government is set to unveil the Jagannath Temple Corridor in Puri through an elaborate ceremony. This corridor is named the Shri Mandir Parikrama Project because it serves the major purpose of seamless circumambulation of the temple by the devotees. It has been prepared at a cost of ₹ 943 crore. It has a green buffer zone of 7 meters and a pedestrian way of 10 meters.Ranjan Kumar Das, chief administrator of the temple said, “We are inviting 857 temples in Odisha, and 180 major Indian temples including Vaishno Devi, Kamakhya Temple and Shirdi Sai temples will also be invited for the three-day inauguration event beginning from January 15. Four Holy Dhams as per Hindu religion and four other Dhams will be invited. We are sending the invitation to the King of Nepal, who enjoys special rights in Jagannath Temple.
